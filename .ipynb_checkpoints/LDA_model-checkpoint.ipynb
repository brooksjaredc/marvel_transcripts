This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you\\'re going to pull over and snuff me. What, you\\'re not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!\\nSoldier: We can talk, sir.\\nTony Stark: Oh, I see. So it\\'s personal?\\nSoldier (female): [She\\'s driving the Vehicle.] No, you intimidate them.\\nTony Stark: Good God, you\\'re a woman. I honestly... I couldn\\'t have called that. I mean, I\\'d apologize, but isn\\'t that what we\\'re going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.\\nSoldier (female): I\\'m an airman.\\nTony Stark: Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I\\'m kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird? [The Soldiers in the vehicle laugh and chuckle.] Come on, it\\'s okay, laugh.\\nSoldier: Sir, I have a question to ask.\\nTony Stark: Yes, please.\\nSoldier: Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year\\'s Maxim cover models?\\nTony Stark: That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else? [The Soldier next to him, Jimmy, raises his hand.] You\\'re kidding me with the hand up, right?\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Is it cool if I take a picture with you?\\nTony Stark: Yes. It\\'s very cool. [The soldier next to him pulls his camera out and hands it to the soldier in the front seat.] I don\\'t want to see this on your MySpace page. [The Soldier puts up a peace sign for the photo.] Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I\\'m kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I\\'d be out of a job with peace.\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don\\'t change any settings. Just click it.\\n[As the picture was about to be taken, something hit and blew up the vehicle in front of them. Gunshots and such were heard and hitting the side of their vehicle.]\\nTony Stark: What\\'s going on?\\nSoldier (female): Contact left!\\nTony Stark: What have we got?\\n[The driver stepped out to go into combat and was shot down]\\nSoldier: Jimmy, stay with Stark!\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Stay down!\\nTony Stark: Yeah.\\n[The other Soldier from the front seat got out to shoot but was shot too]\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Son of a bitch!\\n[Jimmy goes out to fight.]\\nTony Stark: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Stay here!\\n[Jimmy turned back around and he was gunned down too, holes piercing the vehicle. Tony\\'s hearing and senses were dulled a bit as he got himself out of the vehicle, stumbling a bit in the chaos. He got some of his hearing back and ran and dove behind a rock for cover. He pulled out his phone to contact and call for help when a bomb landed next to him. He looked over to see it say: Stark Industries. He tried to get up and get away, but didn\\'t in time. The bomb exploded and made him fly through the air a bit.]\\nTony Stark: Whoa!\\n[He hit the ground hard, senses dulled again. He felt a pain in his chest and pulled his shirt of out the way as blood started to pool.]\\n\\n\\nVoice over: Tony Stark. Visionary. Genius. American patriot. Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT. Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark\\'s lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder, until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries. With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father\\'s legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe.\\nJames Rhodes: As liaison to Stark Industries, I\\'ve had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year\\'s Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark. Tony?\\nObadiah Stane: Thank you, Colonel.\\nJames Rhodes: Thanks for the save.\\nObadiah Stane: This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This is wonderful. Well, I\\'m not Tony Stark. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know...The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He\\'s always working.\\n\\n\\nTony Stark: Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.\\nJames Rhodes: You are unbelievable.\\nTony Stark: Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?\\nJames Rhodes: Nobody roped me into anything!\\nTony Stark: I\\'m so sorry.\\nJames Rhodes: But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you\\'d be deeply honored.\\nTony Stark: Of course I\\'d be deeply honored. And it\\'s you, that\\'s great. So, when do we do it?\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s right here. Here you go.\\nTony Stark: There it is. That was easy. I\\'m so sorry.\\nJames Rhodes: Yeah, it\\'s okay.\\nTony Stark: Wow! Would you look at that? That\\'s something else. I don\\'t have any of those floating around. Uh, we\\'re gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something. [hot girl blows on dice] Okay, you, too. [Tony holds the dice out to Rhodes.]\\nJames Rhodes: I don\\'t blow on a man\\'s dice.\\nTony Stark: Come on, honey bear.\\nJames Rhodes: I don\\'t blow on a man\\'s dice. [Rhodes knocks Tony\\'s hand away causing the dice to roll]\\nTony Stark: There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...\\nDealer: Two craps. Line away.\\nJames Rhodes: That\\'s what happens.\\nTony Stark: Worse things have happened. I think we\\'re gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?\\n[Tony, Rhodes, and Happy leaving the casino.]\\nJames Rhodes: This is where I exit.\\nTony Stark: All right.\\nJames Rhodes: Tomorrow, don\\'t be late.\\nTony Stark: Yeah, you can count on it.\\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m serious!\\nTony Stark: I know, I know. [Handing over his award to Caesar.] Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar\\'s. There you go.\\n[Outside of the casino.]\\nChristine Everhart: Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark! Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?\\nHappy Hogan: [whispering to Tony] She\\'s cute. \\nTony Stark: She\\'s all right? [Turns to face Christine.] Hi.\\nChristine Everhart: Hi.\\nTony Stark: Yeah. Okay-- \\nChristine Everhart: It\\'s okay? \\nTony Stark: Go.\\nChristine Everhart: You\\'ve been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?\\nTony Stark: Absolutely ridiculous. I don\\'t paint.\\nChristine Everhart: And what do you say to your other nickname? \"The Merchant of Death\"?\\nTony Stark: That\\'s not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?\\nChristine Everhart: Brown, actually.\\nTony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It\\'s an imperfect world, but it\\'s the only one we\\'ve got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I\\'ll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.\\nChristine Everhart: You rehearse that much?\\nTony Stark: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.\\nChristine Everhart: I can see that.\\nTony Stark: I\\'d like to show you first-hand.\\nChristine Everhart: All I want is a serious answer.\\nTony Stark: Okay, here\\'s serious. My old man had a philosophy, \"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.\"\\nChristine Everhart: That\\'s a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.\\nTony Stark: My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.\\nChristine Everhart: And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.\\nTony Stark: Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we\\'ve saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.\\nChristine Everhart: You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?\\nTony Stark: I\\'d be prepared to lose a few with you.\\n[They go to Malibu and have sex.]\\nJARVIS: Good morning. It\\'s 7:00 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds. The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines. High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.\\nChristine Everhart: [Walking around Tony\\'s mansion.] Tony? Hey, Tony? [Tries to play with the controls on the wall. It beeps at her.]\\nJARVIS: You are not authorized to access this area.\\nChristine Everhart: Jesus.\\nPepper Potts: That\\'s JARVIS. He runs the house. I\\'ve got your clothes here. They\\'ve been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there\\'s a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you\\'d like to go.\\nChristine Everhart: You must be the famous Pepper Potts.\\nPepper Potts: Indeed I am.\\nChristine Everhart: After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning.\\nPepper Potts: I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?\\n\\n\\n[Tony working on a car in his workshop]\\nTony Stark: Give me an exploded view. \\nJARVIS: The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.\\nTony Stark: Log that.\\nPepper Potts: [Coming in on her phone.] I\\'m gonna try again, right now.\\nTony Stark: Please don\\'t turn down my music.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'ll keep you posted. [Getting off the phone.] You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.\\nTony Stark: How\\'d she take it?\\nPepper Potts: Like a champ.\\nTony Stark: Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?\\nPepper Potts: Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.\\nPepper Potts: Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door.\\nTony Stark: I mean, doesn\\'t it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?\\nPepper Potts: Larry called. He\\'s got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.\\nTony Stark: Is it a good representation of his spring period?\\nPepper Potts: Um, no. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked-- \\nTony Stark: So?\\nPepper Potts: --not \"spring\" like the season. I think it\\'s a fair example. Um.. I think it\\'s incredibly overpriced.\\nTony Stark: I need it. Buy it. Store it.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. The MIT commencement speech...\\nTony Stark: Is in June. Please, don\\'t harangue me about stuff that\\'s way, way, down...\\nPepper Potts: Well, they\\'re haranguing me, so I\\'m gonna say yes.\\nTony Stark: Deflect it and absorb it. Don\\'t transmit it back to me.\\nPepper Potts: I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.\\nTony Stark: What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?\\nPepper Potts: As a matter of fact, I do.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t like it when you have plans.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'m allowed to have plans on my birthday.\\nTony Stark: It\\'s your birthday?\\nPepper Potts: Yes.\\nTony Stark: I knew that. Already?\\nPepper Potts: Yeah. Isn\\'t that strange? It\\'s the same day as last year.\\nTony Stark: Well, get yourself something nice from me.\\nPepper Potts: I already did.\\nTony Stark: And?\\nPepper Potts: Oh, it was very nice.\\nTony Stark: Yeah.\\nPepper Potts: Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.\\nTony Stark: You\\'re welcome, Miss Potts... Okay.\\n\\n\\n[Happy and Tony racing to the airport and arriving.]\\nTony Stark: You\\'re good. I thought I lost you back there.\\nHappy: You did, sir. [Grabbing Tony\\'s things from the trunk.] I had to cut across Mulholland.\\nTony Stark: I got you. I got you.\\nJames Rhodes: What\\'s wrong with you? [Standing at the jet doorway.]\\nTony Stark: What?\\nJames Rhodes: Three hours.\\nTony Stark: I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.\\nJames Rhodes: For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.\\nTony Stark: Waiting on you now. Let\\'s go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll! \\n\\n\\n[inside the jet.]\\nTony Stark: What you reading, platypus?\\nJames Rhodes: Nothing.\\nTony Stark: Come on, sour patch. \\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m not sour.\\nTony Stark: Don\\'t be mad.\\nJames Rhodes: I told you, I\\'m not mad. I\\'m indifferent, okay?\\nTony Stark: I said I was sorry.\\nFlight Attendant #1: Good morning, Mr. Stark.\\nJames Rhodes: You don\\'t need to apologize to me. \\nTony Stark: I told you I was sorry.\\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m your man.\\nTony Stark: Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...\\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m just indifferent right now. \\nFlight Attendant #1: Hot towel?\\nJames Rhodes: You don\\'t respect yourself, so I know you don\\'t respect me.\\nTony Stark: I respect you.\\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m just your babysitter. So, when you need your diaper changed... [grabs a hot towel] Thank you. Let me know and I\\'ll get you a bottle, okay?\\nTony Stark: Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me.\\nJames Rhodes: No, I\\'m not talking... We\\'re not drinking. We\\'re working right now.\\nTony Stark: You can\\'t have sashimi without sake.\\nJames Rhodes: You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.\\nTony Stark: It would be irresponsible not to drink. I\\'m just talking about a nightcap.\\nFlight Attendant #2: Hot sake?\\nTony Stark: Yes, two, please.\\nJames Rhodes: No. Just-- I\\'m not drinking. I don\\'t want any.\\n\\n\\n[Rhodes and Tony drunk on the couch and the flight attendants dancing around them.]\\nJames Rhodes: That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. When I get up in the morning and I\\'m putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that\\'s got this uniform on got my back!\\nTony Stark: Hey, you know what? I\\'m not like you. I\\'m not cut out...\\nJames Rhodes: No, no. You don\\'t have to be like me! But you\\'re more than what you are.\\nTony Stark: Can you excuse me if I\\'m a bit distracted here?\\nJames Rhodes: No! You can\\'t be distracted right now! Listen to me!\\n\\n\\n[Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan.]\\nTony Stark: General.\\nGeneral: Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.\\nTony Stark: Thanks.\\n\\n\\n[Tony giving his presentation in the desert of Afghanistan.]\\nTony Stark: Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries\\' Freedom Line. It\\'s the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That\\'s how Dad did it. That\\'s how America does it. And it\\'s worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won\\'t even want to come out of their caves. [The missiles get launched.] For your consideration, the Jericho. [The missiles explode]\\n\\n\\nTony Stark: [Opening a cooler full of alcohol]I\\'ll be throwing one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more. To peace! [Tony\\'s phone begins ringing.]\\nObadiah Stane: [through the video chat] Tony.\\nTony Stark: Obie, what are you doing up?\\nObadiah Stane: I couldn\\'t sleep till I found out how it went. How\\'d it go?\\nTony Stark: It went great. Looks like it\\'s gonna be an early Christmas.\\nObadiah Stane: Hey! Way to go, my boy! I\\'ll see you tomorrow, yeah?\\nTony Stark: Why aren\\'t you wearing those pajamas I got you?\\nObadiah Stane: Good night, Tony. [Tony hangs up the call as he enters the military vehicle.]\\nJames Rhodes: Hey, Tony. [Coming up to the vehicle Tony\\'s in.]\\nTony Stark:  I\\'m sorry, this is the \"fun-vee.\" The \"hum-drum-vee\" is back there.\\nJames Rhodes: Nice job.\\nTony Stark: See you back at base.\\n\\n\\n[Replay of the attack in the first scene mixed with Tony have surgery and screaming. Tony wakes up suddenly with a tube up his nose, laying on a cot in a cave. He rips out the tube and tries to pick up a cup on the table beside him, but fails. He notices a man shaving and tries to reach further but is stopped by wires.]\\nYinsen: I wouldn\\'t do that if I were you.\\n[Tony realizes that he\\'s connected to a battery. He rips off the bandages over his chest to see an electromagnet inside his chest]\\n\\n\\n[Yinsen and Tony sitting by a small fire. Yinsen is making food while Tony is using a mirror to look at his chest.]\\nTony Stark: What the hell did you do to me?\\nYinsen: What I did? What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there\\'s a lot left, and it\\'s headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see? [Pulls out a bottle of shrapnel.] I have a souvenir. Take a look. [Tosses the bottle to Tony] I\\'ve seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.\\nTony Stark: What is this?\\nYinsen: That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it\\'s keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. Hmm? [Tony sips up the jacket he\\'s wearing and looks at the camera on the ceiling.] That\\'s right. Smile. We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t remember.\\nYinsen: No, you wouldn\\'t. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn\\'t have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.\\nTony Stark: Where are we?\\n[Loud voices sound from the another side of the metal door as they open it.]\\nYinsen: Come on, stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do. Come on, put your hands up. \\n[Men walk in with guns.]\\nTony Stark: Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?\\nYinsen: Do you understand me? Do as I do. [A man starts speaking in Arabic. Yinsen translates for him.] He says, \"Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer \"in the history of America.\" [Man speaks in Arabic.] He is honored. [Man speaks in Arabic.] He wants you to build the missile. [Man speaks in Arabic.] The Jericho missile that you demonstrated. [Man speaks in Arabic, handing Yinsen a picture of the Jericho missile.] This one.\\nTony Stark:  I refuse. [Tony then is shown with his head in a large thing of water. Flashes of himself and the electromagnet in his chest are shown.]\\nPepper Potts: Tony! [As a voice in his head as he tries not to drown.]\\n[The men pull him out, put a bag over his head, and escort him out of the cave. Tony sees a lot of men, tents, and his guns. The same man speaking Arabic before speaks again.]\\nYinsen: He wants to know what you think.\\nTony Stark: I think you got a lot of my weapons. \\n[Yinsen translates Tony\\'s words into Arabic. The same man speaking Arabic responds]\\nYinsen: He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials. [Man speaks Arabic again] He says for you to start working immediately, and when you\\'re done, he will set you free.\\nTony Stark: No, he won\\'t. [Shaking the Arabic man\\'s hand.]\\nYinsen: No, he won\\'t.\\n\\n\\nYinsen: [Tony sitting around a small fire in the cave with Tony] I\\'m sure they\\'re looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life\\'s work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it?\\nTony Stark: Why should I do anything? They\\'re going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don\\'t, I\\'ll probably be dead in a week.\\nYinsen: Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn\\'t it? Hm?\\nTony Stark: [Directing the men to where to put things while Yinsen\\'s translating] If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up. I need welding gear. I don\\'t care if it\\'s acetylene or propane. I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I\\'m gonna need goggles. I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools. [Yinsen and Tony start taking apart the weapons.] How many languages do you speak?\\nYinsen: A lot. But apparently, not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.\\nTony Stark: Who are these people?\\nYinsen: They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings. [The men of the Ten Rings are shown watching Tony and Yinsen work on a TV.] You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process.\\nTony Stark: Uh-huh. [Tony pulls apart a missile.] Okay, we don\\'t need this.\\nYinsen: What is that?\\nTony Stark: That\\'s palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don\\'t you go break down the other 11?  \\n\\n\\nMan #1: What\\'s he doing? [speaking Arabic]\\nMan #2: Working. [speaking Arabic]\\n[Tony and Yinsen working on something. Yinsen is pulling something out of the fire.]\\nTony Stark: Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.\\nYinsen: Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you\\'re still alive?\\nTony Stark: What do I call you?\\nYinsen: My name is Yinsen.\\nTony Stark: Yinsen. Nice to meet you.\\nYinsen: Nice to meet you, too. [Tony puts together a device while Yinsen watches.] Whoa. That doesn\\'t look like a Jericho missile.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s because it\\'s a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.\\nYinsen: But what could it generate?\\nTony Stark: If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.\\nYinsen: That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.\\nTony Stark: Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.\\n\\n\\nTony Stark: [Looking at sheets of paper with Tony] This is our ticket out of here.\\nYinsen: What is it?\\nTony Stark: Flatten them out and look. [Yinsen flattens the sheets out to see a drawing of a metal suit.]\\nYinsen: Oh, wow. Impressive.\\n[Security footage shows that the arc reactor was successfully put in Tony, allowing him more freedom of movement without having to carry the car battery around.]\\n\\n\\n[Tony and Yinsen playing a game.]\\nYinsen: Good. Good roll. Good roll.\\nTony Stark: You still haven\\'t told me where you\\'re from.\\nYinsen: I\\'m from a small town called Gulmira. It\\'s actually a nice place.\\nTony Stark: Got a family?\\nYinsen: Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?\\nTony Stark: No.\\nYinsen: No? So you\\'re a man who has everything and nothing.\\n[The men of the Ten Rings come to the door, armed. They open the hatch to see Tony and Yinsen working before turning around and leaving. Shows Tony welding metal together, while the Ten Rings watch the cameras and compare what he\\'s creating with the Jericho picture.]\\nMan #1: It doesn\\'t look anything like the picture. [Speaking Arabic]\\nMan #2: Maybe it\\'s been modified. [Speaking Arabic]\\nMan #1: The tail is wrong. [Speaking Arabic]\\nMan #2: It\\'s just backwards. [Speaking Arabic]\\n[The head of the Ten Rings, Raza, watches Tony and Yinsen test out one of the legs of the suit. He and his men go visit Tony and Yinsen.]\\nRaza: Relax. [Motioning for the two men to remove their hands from above their heads. They do so as Raza comes up and inspects Tony\\'s arc reactor.] The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology. It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine. An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman Empire. But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. And soon, it will be my turn. [Starts speaking in Urdu as he stares down Tony.] Why have you failed me?\\nYinsen: We\\'re working. Diligently. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nRaza: [Turns and walks toward Yinsen.] I let you live. This is how you repay me? [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nYinsen: It\\'s very complex. He\\'s trying very hard. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nRaza: On his knees. [He commands his men in Urdu. Yinsen is forced to his knees.] You think I\\'m a fool? I\\'ll get the truth. [Speaking in Urdu as he takes a coal from the dying fire.]\\nYinsen: We\\'re both working. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nRaza: Open your mouth. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nTony Stark: What does he want?\\nRaza: You think I\\'m a fool? What\\'s going on? Tell me the truth. [Speaking in Urdu. Raza forces Yinsen\\'s head to lay on the table.]\\nYinsen: He\\'s building your Jericho. He\\'s building your Jericho. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nTony Stark: What do you want? A delivery date? [Tony tries to go towards Raza and Yinsen but the other men pull their guns on him.] I need him. Good assistant.\\nRaza: You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile. \\n[Tony is shown hammering the helmet of the suit to shape it. He cools it in water before setting on the table in front of Yinsen. Tony is shown wrapping his hands up and Yinsen lifting the suit up. Yinsen helps Tony suit up.]\\nYinsen: Okay? Can you move? Okay, say it again.\\nTony Stark: 41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that\\'s from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.\\n[Raza notices on the security screens that Stark cannot be seen.]\\nRaza: Where is Stark? [Speaking Arabic]\\nMan: He was here a moment ago. [Speaking Arabic]\\nRaza: Go look for him. [Speaking Arabic]\\n[The men rush to the cell.]\\nMan: Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!\\nTony Stark: Say something. Say something back to him.\\nYinsen: He\\'s speaking Hungarian. I don\\'t...\\nTony Stark: Then speak Hungarian.\\nYinsen: Okay. I know.\\nTony Stark: What do you know? \\n[The men are shouting through the door while Yinsen is shouting something back at them. The door is shown to have an explosive on it. The men try to open the door, only for it to explode. Raza watches this all on camera and orders his men down there.]\\nTony Stark: How\\'d that work?\\nYinsen: Oh, my goodness. It worked all right.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s what I do.\\nYinsen: Let me finish this.\\nTony Stark: Initialize the power sequence.\\nYinsen: Okay.\\nTony Stark: Now!\\nYinsen: Tell me. Tell me. \\nTony Stark: Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now.\\nYinsen: Yes.\\nTony Stark: Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.\\nYinsen: I have it.\\nTony Stark: Press Control \"l\".\\nYinsen: \"I.\" \\nTony Stark: \"I.\" \"Enter.\"\\nYinsen: Got it.\\nTony Stark: \"l\" and \"Enter.\" Come over here and button me up.\\nYinsen: Okay. All right.\\nTony Stark: Every other hex bolt.\\nYinsen: They\\'re coming!\\nTony Stark: Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done.\\nYinsen: They\\'re coming.\\nTony Stark: Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?\\nYinsen: We need more time. Hey, I\\'m gonna go buy you some time.\\nTony Stark: Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan! [Yinsen runs out of the cave with a gun from one of the dead men.] Yinsen! Yinsen!\\n[Tony watches the progress bar move while Yinsen aimlessly shoots the cave walls as he runs, scarring the men. Yinsen is stopped when he reaches the mouth of the cave and a group of men. The progress bar finishes loading, causing the lights to dim, and the suit to be powered. More men arrive in the cave to get Tony. Tony attacks them using the suit. On his way out of the cave, he attacks more of the men. Raza waits at the mouth of the cave. Tony arrives to see Yinsen has been shot.]\\nTony Stark: Yinsen!\\nYinsen: Watch out! [Raza tries to shoot at Tony but misses. Tony shoots back, hitting the wall behind Raza, causing a mini explosion and knocking Raza out.] Stark.\\nTony Stark: Come on. [Tony opens is helmet.] We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We\\'re gonna stick to it.\\nYinsen: This was always the plan, Stark.\\nTony Stark: Come on, you\\'re gonna go see your family. Get up.\\nYinsen: My family is dead. I\\'m going to see them now, Stark. It\\'s okay. I want this. I want this.\\nTony Stark: Thank you for saving me.\\nYinsen: Don\\'t waste it. Don\\'t waste your life.\\n[Yinsen dies. Tony turns angry. There are men waiting outside of the mouth of the cave. They all shoot at Tony in the suit, but don\\'t do any damage.]\\nTony Stark: My turn. [Tony shoots fire at the men and their camp from his suit. The men continue to shoot at Tony, beginning to cause damage to the suit. Tony flips a suit and shoots up in the air. He screams as he falls into the sand on the other side of the mountains. The suit breaks when he lands.] Not bad.\\n[Tony then is seen wondering through the desert, exhausted. Military helicopters fly up from behind him.]\\nTony Stark: Hey! [Waving down the helicopters.] Hey!\\n[As one of the helicopters lands, Tony collapses to his knees, holding up a peace sign. Rhodey and a few men are seen running up to Tony from the helicopter.]\\nJames Rhodes: How was the \"fun-vee\"? Next time, you ride with me, okay?\\n\\n\\n[California Military Base where a giant plane has just landed. Medical, Happy, and Pepper are waiting there. The ramp lowers and Rhodey helps Tony down.]\\nJames Rhodes: Watch it, coming up here.\\nTony Stark: Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them. [Tony walks up to Pepper.] Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?\\nPepper Potts: Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.\\nTony Stark: Yeah, vacation\\'s over.\\n[Tony, Pepper, and Happy get into the car.]\\nHappy: Where to, sir?\\nPepper Potts: Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.\\nTony Stark: No.\\nPepper Potts: No? Tony, you have to go to the hospital.\\nTony Stark: No is a complete answer.\\nPepper Potts: The doctor has to look at you.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t have to do anything. I\\'ve been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...\\nPepper Potts: That\\'s enough of that.\\nTony Stark: ...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.\\nPepper Potts: Call for a press conference?\\nTony Stark: Yeah.\\nPepper Potts: What on earth for?\\nTony Stark: Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.\\n\\n\\n[Happy driving them up to Stark Industries HQ, where Obadiah is waiting with the press and their employees.]\\nObadiah Stane: Look at this! Tony. We were going to meet at the hospital.\\nTony Stark: No, I\\'m fine.\\nObadiah Stane: Look at you! You had to have a burger, yeah?\\nTony Stark: Well, come on.\\nObadiah Stane: You get me one of those?\\nTony Stark: There\\'s only one left. I need it.\\nObadiah Stane: Hey, look who\\'s here! Yeah!\\nAgent Coulson: Miss Potts?\\nPepper Potts: Yes.\\nAgent Coulson: Can I speak to you for a moment?\\nPepper Potts: I\\'m not part of the press conference, but it\\'s about to begin right now.\\nAgent Coulson: I\\'m not a reporter. I\\'m Agent Phil Coulson, with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.\\nPepper Potts: That\\'s quite a mouthful.\\nAgent Coulson: I know. We\\'re working on it.\\nPepper Potts: You know, we\\'ve been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...\\nAgent Coulson: We\\'re a separate division with a more specific focus. We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'ll put something in the book, shall I?\\nAgent Coulson: Thank you.\\nObadiah Stane: Well, let\\'s get this started, uh...\\nTony Stark: Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down? [Sitting in front of the podium.] Why don\\'t you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can... A little less formal and... [Tony takes a bite of his cheeseburger as everyone sits, or squats, down]\\nJames Rhodes: What\\'s up with the love-in? \\nPepper Potts: Don\\'t look at me. I don\\'t know what he\\'s up to.\\nTony Stark: Good to see you.\\nObadiah Stane: Good to see you.\\nTony Stark: I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There\\'s questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.\\nReporters: Mr. Stark!\\nTony Stark: Hey, Ben.\\nReporter (Ben): What happened over there?\\nTony Stark: I had my eyes opened. [Tony stands and moves behind the podium.] I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International [Everyone stands up in commotion.] until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.\\nObadiah Stane: I think we\\'re gonna be selling a lot of newspapers. [Standing up beside Tony.]\\nTony Stark: What direction it should take, one that I\\'m comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well. [Tony leaves the stage.]\\nObadiah Stane: What we should take away from this is that Tony\\'s back! And he\\'s healthier than ever. We\\'re going to have a little internal discussion and we\\'ll get back to you with the follow-up. [Obadiah is shown on a Segway, riding up to one of the Stark buildings. Happy leaning against a car outside.] Where is he?\\nHappy: He\\'s inside. \\n[Obadiah goes inside to find Tony looking at the giant arc reactor.]\\nObadiah Stane: Well, that..uh... That went well.\\nTony Stark: Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?\\nObadiah Stane: Your head? What about my head? What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?\\nTony Stark: Uh, optimistically, 40 points.\\nObadiah Stane: At minimum.\\nTony Stark: Yep.\\nObadiah Stane: Tony, we\\'re a weapons manufacturer.\\nTony Stark: Obie, I just don\\'t want a body count to be our only legacy.\\nObadiah Stane: That\\'s what we do. We\\'re iron mongers. We make weapons.\\nTony Stark: It\\'s my name on the side of the building.\\nObadiah Stane: And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.\\nTony Stark: Not based on what I saw. We\\'re not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We\\'re gonna do something else.\\nObadiah Stane: Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?\\nTony Stark: I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.\\nObadiah Stane: Ah, come on. The arc reactor, that\\'s a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up.\\nTony Stark: It works.\\nObadiah Stane: Yeah, as a science project. The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology, that\\'s a dead end, right?\\nTony Stark: Maybe.\\nObadiah Stane: Huh? Am I right? We haven\\'t had a breakthrough in that in what? Thirty years.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?\\nObadiah Stane: Never mind who told me. Show me.\\nTony Stark: It\\'s Rhodey or Pepper.\\nObadiah Stane: I want to see it.\\nTony Stark: Okay, Rhodey. [Tony opens his shirt to show Obadiah the reactor in his chest.]\\nObadiah Stane: Okay. [Obadiah begins to button Tony\\'s shirt back up.]\\nTony Stark: Okay? It works.\\nObadiah Stane: Listen to me, Tony. We\\'re a team. Do you understand? There\\'s nothing we can\\'t do if we stick together, like your father and I.\\nTony Stark: I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had...\\nObadiah Stane: Tony. Tony, no more of this \"ready, fire, aim\" business. You understand me?\\nTony Stark: That was Dad\\'s line.\\nObadiah Stane: You gotta let me handle this. We\\'re gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now. We\\'re going to have to take a lot of heat. I want you to promise me that you\\'re gonna lay low.\\n\\n\\n[Stark Mansion, where Pepper is watching the news.]\\nNewcaster: Stark Industries! I\\'ve got one recommendation! Ready? Ready? Sell, sell, sell! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan! Look, that\\'s a weapons company that doesn\\'t make weapons!\\nTony Stark: [Over the intercoms] Pepper. How big are your hands?\\nPepper Potts: What?\\nTony Stark: How big are your hands?\\nPepper Potts: I don\\'t understand why...\\nTony Stark: Get down here. I need you. [Pepper enters Tony\\'s workshop to find Tony lying shirtless on a chair.] Hey. Let\\'s see them. Show me your hands. Let\\'s see them. [Pepper holds up her hands as she comes closer.] Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec.\\nPepper Potts: Oh, my God, is that the thing that\\'s keeping you alive?\\nTony Stark: It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I\\'m swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.\\nPepper Potts: Speed bump, what does that mean?\\nTony Stark: It\\'s nothing. It\\'s just a little snag. There\\'s an exposed wire under this device. And it\\'s contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It\\'s fine. [Tony pulls out the old device, handing it to Pepper.]\\nPepper Potts: What do you want me to do?\\nTony Stark: Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.\\nPepper Potts: Oh, my God! [Setting the old reactor on the table.]\\nTony Stark: I want you to reach in, and you\\'re just gonna gently lift the wire out.\\nPepper Potts: Is it safe?\\nTony Stark: Yeah, it should be fine. It\\'s like Operation. You just don\\'t let it touch the socket wall or it goes \"beep.\"\\nPepper Potts: What do you mean, \"Operation\"?\\nTony Stark: It\\'s just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire. \\nPepper Potts: Okay.\\nTony Stark: Okay? Great.\\nPepper Potts: You know, I don\\'t think that I\\'m qualified to do this.\\nTony Stark: No, you\\'re fine. You\\'re the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I\\'ve ever met. You\\'re gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? \\'Cause I\\'m...\\nPepper Potts: Okay, okay.\\nTony Stark: I really need your help here.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. [Slides her hand into the hole in Tony\\'s chest.] Oh, there\\'s pus!\\nTony Stark: It\\'s not pus. It\\'s an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body.\\nPepper Potts: It smells!\\nTony Stark: Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?\\nPepper Potts: Okay, I got it! I got it!\\nTony Stark: Okay, you got it? Now, don\\'t let it touch [Pepper lets it touch the side.] the sides when you\\'re coming out!\\nPepper Potts: I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don\\'t... [Pepper pulls out the wire with the magnet attached and the medical equipment starts beeping.] There\\'s a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.\\nPepper Potts: Oh, God!\\nTony Stark: Okay, I was not expecting... \\nPepper Potts: Okay, what do I do?\\nTony Stark: Don\\'t put it back in! Don\\'t put it back in!\\nPepper Potts: What\\'s wrong?\\nTony Stark: Nothing, I\\'m just going into cardiac arrest-- \\nPepper Potts: What? You said it was safe!\\nTony Stark: \\'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. Okay. Tony? \\nTony Stark: What?\\nPepper Potts: It\\'s going to be okay. Okay?\\nTony Stark: Is it?\\nPepper Potts: It\\'s gonna be okay. I\\'m gonna make this okay.\\nTony Stark: Let\\'s hope. Okay, you\\'re gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you... [Screams went it attaches.] Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice.\\nPepper Potts: Are you okay?\\nTony Stark: Yeah, I feel great. You okay?\\nPepper Potts: Don\\'t ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t have anyone but you. Anyway... [Tony rips on the wires off and stands up.]\\nPepper Potts: What do you want me to do with this? [Holding Tony\\'s old reactor.]\\nTony Stark: That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.\\nPepper Potts: You don\\'t want to keep it?\\nTony Stark: Pepper, I\\'ve been called many things. \"Nostalgic\" is not one of them.\\nPepper Potts: Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\\nTony Stark: That will be all, Miss Potts. [Turns to talk to his robot while he eyes Pepper as she walks away.] Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What\\'s all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That\\'s my phone, that\\'s a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.\\n\\n\\n[Air Force Base where Rhodes is guiding a group of people through the hanger.]\\nJames Rhodes: The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I\\'ll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot\\'s instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot\\'s judgment.\\nTony Stark: Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?\\nJames Rhodes: Look who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.\\nMan: Hello, sir. \\nTony Stark: Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with.\\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that!\\nTony Stark: What was his name?\\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that.\\nTony Stark: Was it Ivan?\\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that. They\\'ll believe it. \\nTony Stark: Okay.\\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that.\\nTony Stark: Okay.  \\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that.\\nTony Stark: Pleasure meeting you.\\nJames Rhodes: Give us a couple minutes, you guys. [The group walks off.] I\\'m surprised.\\nTony Stark: Why?\\nJames Rhodes: I swear, I didn\\'t expect to see you walking around so soon.\\nTony Stark: I\\'m doing a little better than walking.\\nJames Rhodes: Really?\\nTony Stark: Yeah. Rhodey, I\\'m working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.\\nJames Rhodes: You\\'re about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, \\'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy.\\nTony Stark: This is not for the military. I\\'m not... It\\'s different.\\nJames Rhodes: What? You\\'re a humanitarian now or something?\\nTony Stark: I need you to listen to me.\\nJames Rhodes: No. What you need is time to get your mind right. I\\'m serious.\\nTony Stark: Okay.\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s nice seeing you, Tony. [Rhodey walks off.]\\nTony Stark: Thanks.\\n\\n\\n[Tony in his workshop, working on his computer and hologram table.]\\nTony Stark: JARVIS, you up?\\nJARVIS: For you, sir, always.\\nTony Stark: I\\'d like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two.\\nJARVIS: Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?\\nTony Stark: Actually, I don\\'t know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don\\'t we just keep everything on my private server?\\nJARVIS: Working on a secret project, are we, sir?\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.\\n\\n\\n[men from the Ten Rings searching the desert for Tony\\'s suit. Shows that part of Raza\\'s face was burned]\\n\\n\\n[Tony working on a boot for the new suit in his workshop. His robot, Dummy, is assisting him.]\\nTony Stark: Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You\\'re of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I\\'m sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don\\'t even move. You are a tragedy.\\n\\n\\n[Tony wearing the boots in his workshop for a test flight. One of the robots is filming it, while Dummy is in charge of the fire extinguisher.]\\nTony Stark: Okay, let\\'s do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You\\'re on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We\\'re gonna start off nice and easy. We\\'re gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one. \\n[Tony immediately flings back and hits the upper wall. Dummy uses the fire extinguisher on him. Tony is then seen working on flight stabilizers for his hands/arms. While he\\'s working, Pepper comes in with a wrapped box and a cup of something.]\\nTony Stark: Up two. All right, set that.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'ve been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?\\nTony Stark: Yeah, everything\\'s... What? [Still distracted with the flight stabilizer.]\\nPepper Potts: Obadiah\\'s upstairs.\\nTony Stark: Great!\\nPepper Potts: What would you like me to tell him?\\nTony Stark: Great. I\\'ll be right up.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. I thought you said you were done making weapons.\\nTony Stark: It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It\\'s completely harmless. [The stabilizer shoots, flinging Tony backwards and scaring Pepper.] I didn\\'t expect that. [Tony then comes up stairs to find Obadiah playing the piano and Pepper working on the couch.] How\\'d it go? It went that bad, huh?\\nObadiah Stane: Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn\\'t mean it went bad. [Still playing the piano.]\\nTony Stark: Sure doesn\\'t. Oh, boy.\\nObadiah Stane: It would have gone better if you were there.\\nTony Stark: Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That\\'s what I\\'ve been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all...\\nObadiah Stane: Hey, come on. In public. The press. [Comes over to sit next to Tony.] This was a board of directors meeting.\\nTony Stark: This was a board of directors meeting?\\nObadiah Stane: The board is claiming you have post-traumatic stress. They\\'re filing an injunction.\\nTony Stark: A what?\\nObadiah Stane: They want to lock you out.\\nTony Stark: Why, \\'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen.\\nPepper Potts: Fifty-six and a half.\\nTony Stark: It doesn\\'t matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.\\nObadiah Stane: Tony, the board has rights, too. They\\'re making the case that you and your new direction isn\\'t in the company\\'s best interest.\\nTony Stark: I\\'m being responsible! That\\'s a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company\\'s behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great. [Tony stands up, taking the pizza box with him. Obadiah follows.]\\nObadiah Stane: Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.\\nTony Stark: I\\'ll be in the shop.\\nObadiah Stane: Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen. I\\'m trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them. Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs.\\nTony Stark: No. No, absolutely not.\\nObadiah Stane: It\\'ll give me a bone to throw the boys in New York!\\nTony Stark: This one stays with me. That\\'s it, Obie. Forget it.\\nObadiah Stane: All right, well, this stays with me, then. [Obadiah takes the pizza box back.] Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two.\\nTony Stark: Thank you.\\nObadiah Stane: You mind if I come down there and see what you\\'re doing?\\nTony Stark: Good night, Obie. [Tony heads back down to his workshop]\\n\\n\\nTony Stark: [running another flight test, this time wearing the boots and hand flight stabilizers] Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again, and I\\'m not on fire, I\\'m donating you to a city college. All right, nice and easy. Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three, two, one. [Lifts off the ground and hovers for a bit before landing.] Okay. Please don\\'t follow me around with it, either, \\'cause I feel like I\\'m gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down! If something happens, then come in. And again, let\\'s bring it up to 2.5. Three, two, one. [Lifts off the ground with less control and starts hovering all over the workshop.] Okay, this is where I don\\'t want to be! Not the car, not the car! Table! Could be worse! Could be worse! We\\'re fine! Okay. [Lands where he started. Dummy goes to use the fire extinguisher.] No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly.\\n\\n\\n[Tony fully suiting up in the Mark II.]\\nTony Stark: JARVIS, are you there?\\nJARVIS: At your service, sir.\\nTony Stark: Engage heads-up display.\\nJARVIS: Check.\\nTony Stark: Import all preferences from home interface.\\nJARVIS: Will do, sir.\\nTony Stark: All right, what do you say?\\nJARVIS: I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We\\'re online and ready.\\nTony Stark: Can we start the virtual walk-around?\\nJARVIS: Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.\\nTony Stark: Do a check on control surfaces\\nJARVIS: As you wish. [The full suit is shown.] Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.\\nTony Stark: Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control.\\nJARVIS: Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is...\\nTony Stark: JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one. [Begins hovering and flies out of the garage into the sky.] Handles like a dream. All right, let\\'s see what this thing can do. What\\'s SR-71\\'s record?\\nJARVIS: The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.\\nTony Stark: Records are made to be broken! Come on! [Begins flying straight up.]\\nJARVIS: Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.\\nTony Stark: Keep going! Higher! [Ice builds up around the suit, causing it to stop working and him to start flying from the sky.] We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice! \\n[Tony manually gets the flaps up. The power starts just it time before he crashes into traffic. He heads back to the mansion and hovers above it, hoping to safely land on the roof.]\\nTony Stark: Kill power. \\n[Power is killed and Tony falls through the roof, the piano, and down into his workshop, landing on top of a car. Dummy uses the fire extinguisher on him]\\n\\n\\n[Tony out of the suit, walking around the workshop with an ice pack on his head. He picks up the cup that Pepper left earlier and notices the package she left. On top, it has a sticky note saying \\'from Pepper\\'. He takes it off and opens the package.]\\nNotes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude.\\nHull pressurization is problematic. I\\'m thinking icing is the probable factor.\\nJARVIS: A very astute observation, sir.\\nPerhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.\\nConnect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals.\\nUse the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite.\\nThat should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.\\n- Got it?\\n- Yes.\\nShall I render using proposed specifications?\\nThrill me.\\nTV Reporter: Tonight\\'s red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark\\'s third annual benefit\\nfor the Firefighter\\'s Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.\\'s high society.\\nTony Stark: JARVIS, we get an invite for that?\\nJARVIS: I have no record of an invitation, sir.\\nTV Reporter: ... hasn\\'t been seen in public since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference. Some claim he\\'s suffering from post traumatic stress and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight.\\nJARVIS: The render is complete.\\nTony Stark: A little ostentatious, don\\'t you think?\\nJARVIS: What was I thinking? You\\'re usually so discreet.\\nTony Stark: Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.\\nJARVIS: Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.\\nTony Stark: Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.\\nJARVIS: Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.\\nTony Stark: Don\\'t wait up for me, honey.\\nWeapons manufacturing is only one small part of what Stark Industries is all about, and our partnership with the fire and rescue community...\\nRandom Woman: Hey, Tony, remember me?\\nTony Stark: Sure don\\'t. You look great, Hef.\\nObadiah Stane: We\\'re going to have a great quarter.\\nTony Stark: What\\'s the world coming to when a guy\\'s got to crash his own party?\\nObadiah Stane: Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.\\nTony Stark: I\\'ll see you inside.\\nObadiah Stane: Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right? I think I got the board right where we want them\\nTony Stark: You got it. Just cabin fever. I\\'ll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I\\'m starving.\\nAgent Coulson: Mr. Stark?\\nTony Stark: Yeah?\\nAgent Coulson: Agent Coulson.\\nTony Stark: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the..\\nAgent Coulson: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.\\nTony Stark: God, you need a new name for that.\\nAgent Coulson: Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There\\'s still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things.\\nTony Stark: Let\\'s just put something on the books.\\nAgent Coulson: How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?\\nTony Stark: Tell you what. You got it. You\\'re absolutely right. Well, I\\'m going to go to my assistant, and we\\'ll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn\\'t recognize you.\\nPepper Potts: What are you doing here?\\nTony Stark: Just avoiding government agents.\\nPepper Potts: Are you by yourself?\\nTony Stark: Yes. Where\\'d you get that dress?\\nPepper Potts: Oh, it was a birthday present.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s great.\\nPepper Potts: From you, actually.\\nTony Stark: Well, I got great taste.\\nPepper Potts: Yes.\\nTony Stark: You want to dance?\\nPepper Potts: Oh, no.\\nTony Stark: All right, come on.\\nPepper Potts: Thank you. No.\\nTony Stark: Am I making you uncomfortable?\\nPepper Potts: No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.\\nTony Stark: You look great and you smell great.\\nPepper Potts: Oh, God.\\nTony Stark: But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.\\nPepper Potts: I actually don\\'t think that you could tie your shoes without me.\\nTony Stark: I\\'d make it a week. Sure.\\nPepper Potts: Really? What\\'s your Social Security number?\\nTony Stark: Five.\\nPepper Potts: Five?\\nTony Stark: Right.\\nPepper Potts: Right. You\\'re missing just a couple of digits there.\\nTony Stark: The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?\\nPepper Potts: Yes, I need some air. That was totally weird.\\nTony Stark: Totally harmless.\\nPepper Potts: It was totally not harmless, by the way.\\nTony Stark: We\\'re dancing. No one\\'s even watching.\\nEverybody who I work with...\\nNo, you know why?\\nI think you lost objectivity. I think\\nthey just... People... We just danced.\\nPepper Potts: No, it was not just a dance. You don\\'t understand because you\\'re you. And everybody knows exactly who you are and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine. But, you know, then me, you\\'re my boss, and I\\'m dancing with you.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t think it was taken that way.\\nPepper Potts: Because it makes me look like the one who\\'s trying to...\\nTony Stark: I just think you\\'re overstating it.\\nPepper Potts: You know, and we\\'re here, and then I\\'m wearing this ridiculous dress, and then we were dancing like that and... I would like a drink, please.\\nTony Stark: Got it, okay.\\nPepper Potts: I would like a vodka martini, please.\\nTony Stark: Okay.\\nPepper Potts: Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.\\nTony Stark: Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?\\nChristine Everhart: Wow. Tony Stark.\\nTony Stark: Oh, hey.\\nChristine Everhart: Fancy seeing you here.\\nTony Stark: Carrie.\\nChristine Everhart: Christine.\\nTony Stark: Carrie.\\nChristine Everhart: Christine.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s right.\\nChristine Everhart: You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?\\nTony Stark: Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.\\nChristine Everhart: \\'Cause I was referring to your company\\'s involvement in this latest atrocity\\nTony Stark: Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don\\'t know what to tell you.\\nChristine Everhart: I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.\\nTony Stark: I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn\\'t hear.\\nChristine Everhart: Is this what you call accountability? It\\'s a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?\\nTony Stark: When were these taken?\\nChristine Everhart: Yesterday.\\nTony Stark: I didn\\'t approve any shipment.\\nChristine Everhart: Well, your company did.\\nTony Stark: Well, I\\'m not my company.\\nObadiah Stane: Please, do you mind?\\nTony Stark: Have you seen these pictures? What\\'s going on in Gulmira?\\nObadiah Stane: Tony, Tony. You can\\'t afford to be this naive.\\nTony Stark: You know what? I was naive before, when they said, \"Here\\'s the line. We don\\'t cross it. This is how we do business.\" If we\\'re double-dealing under the table... Are we?\\nReporter: Tony, your picture, please!\\nObadiah Stane: Let\\'s take a picture. Come on. Picture time! Tony. Who do you think locked you out? I was the one who filed the injunction against you. It was the only way I could protect you.\\nObadiah Stane: No. No.\\nTV Reporter: The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there\\'s very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia. Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs, holding them up to anyone who will stop. A child\\'s simple question, \"Where are my mother and father?\" There\\'s very little hope for these refugees, refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.\\nTony Stark: He\\'s all yours.\\n\\n\\nCaptain: What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?\\nCAOC Analyst #1: No sir, they were using human shields. We never got the green light\\nMajor Allen: Put me through to State. They\\'re going to be all over this.\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Get those monitors up!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): We got a bogey!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Wasn\\'t Air Force!\\nMajor Allen: We got the CIA on the line?\\nCaptain: I\\'ve got Langley on the line. They want to know if it\\'s us.\\nCAOC Analyst #1: No, it definitely is not us, sir!\\nCAOC Analyst #2: It wasn\\'t Navy.\\nCAOC Analyst #3: Wasn\\'t Marines.\\nMajor Allen: I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Negative, negative. Cannot identify.\\nMajor Allen: Get me Colonel Rhodes from weapons development down here now!\\nMajor Allen: We ran an ID check and cross-referenced with all known databases. We have nothing.\\nJames Rhodes: Any high-altitude surveillance in the region?\\nCaptain: We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.\\nJames Rhodes: So, this thing just appeared out of nowhere? How come it didn\\'t show up on the radar?\\nCAOC Analyst #1: Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.\\nJames Rhodes: Is it stealth?\\nCAOC Analyst #1: No, sir, it\\'s tiny. We think it\\'s an unmanned aerial vehicle.\\nMajor Allen: Colonel, what are we dealing with here?\\nJames Rhodes: Let me make a call.\\nMajor Allen: Sergeant, clear a hole.\\nTony Stark: Hello?\\nJames Rhodes: Tony?\\nTony Stark: Who\\'s this?\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s Rhodes.\\nTony Stark: Sorry, hello?\\nJames Rhodes: I said it\\'s Rhodes.\\nTony Stark: Speak up, please.\\nJames Rhodes: What in the hell is that noise?\\nTony Stark: Oh, yeah, I\\'m driving with the top down.\\nJames Rhodes: Yeah, well, I need your help right now.\\nTony Stark: It\\'s funny how that works, huh?\\nJames Rhodes: Yeah. Speaking of funny, we\\'ve got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive.\\nTony Stark: Well, that\\'s a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?\\nJames Rhodes: Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?\\nTony Stark: I\\'m not, I was just jogging in the canyon.\\nJames Rhodes: I thought you were driving.\\nTony Stark: Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I\\'m going to jog.\\nJames Rhodes: You sure you don\\'t have any tech in that area I should know about?\\nTony Stark: Nope!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Bogey spotted!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Whiplash, come in hot.\\nJames Rhodes: Okay, good, \\'cause I\\'m staring at one right now, and it\\'s about to be blown to kingdom come.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s my exit.\\nPilot #1: Ballroom, this is Whiplash One. I\\'ve got the bogey in my sights.\\nJames Rhodes: Whiplash One, what is it?\\nPilot #1: I\\'ve got no idea.\\nMajor Allen: You have radio contact?\\nPilot #1: Non responsive, sir.\\nMajor Allen: Then you are clear to engage.\\nTony Stark: Hit it.\\nPilot #1: That bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!\\nJARVIS: Inbound missile.\\nTony Stark: Flares!\\nPilot #1: Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!\\nTony Stark: Deploy flaps!\\nPilot #2: Holy!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.\\nCAOC Analyst #2: The sat visual has been lost.\\nPilot #1: No way that\\'s a UAV.\\nMajor Allen: What is it?\\nPilot #2: I can\\'t see anything.\\nPilot #1: Whatever it was, it just bought the farm. I think bogey\\'s been handled, sir.\\nJames Rhodes: Hello?\\nTony Stark: Hi, Rhodey, it\\'s me.\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s who?\\nTony Stark: I\\'m sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me.\\nJames Rhodes: No, see, this isn\\'t a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?\\nTony Stark: This is not a piece of equipment. I\\'m in it. It\\'s a suit. It\\'s me!\\nMajor Allen: Rhodey, you got anything for me?\\nMajor Allen: Mark your position and return to base.\\nPilot #1: Roger that, Ballroom.\\nPilot #1: On your belly! It looks like a man! Shake him off! Roll! Roll! I\\'m hit! I\\'m hit!\\nIt\\'s confirmed. He has been hit.\\nPilot #2: Punch out! Punch out! Whiplash One down.\\nWhiplash Two, do you see a chute?\\nPilot #2: Negative! No chute, no chute!\\nPilot #1: My chute\\'s jammed!\\nPilot #2: Sir, I\\'ve got a visual on the bogey.\\nMajor Allen: Whiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it.\\nJames Rhodes: Major, we don\\'t even know what we\\'re shooting at. Call off the Raptors.\\nMajor Allen: That thing just took out an F-22 inside a legal no fly zone! Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!\\nJARVIS: You\\'ve been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.\\nTony Stark1: Keep going!\\nPilot #2: Good chute! Good chute!\\nJames Rhodes: Tony, you still there?\\nTony Stark: Hey, thanks.\\nJames Rhodes: Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right?\\nTony Stark: Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I\\'m working on?\\nJames Rhodes: No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?\\nTony Stark: Training exercise. Isn\\'t that the usual BS?\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s not that simple. An unfortunate training exercise involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday. I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured. As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira, it is still unclear who or what intervened, but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved. \\nTony Stark: Hey!\\nJARVIS: It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.\\nTony Stark: Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to...\\nJARVIS: Please, try not to move, sir.\\nPepper Potts: What\\'s going on here?\\nTony Stark: Let\\'s face it. This is not the worst thing you\\'ve caught me doing.\\nPepper Potts: Are those bullet holes?\\nWelcome.\\nCompliments of Tony Stark.\\nObadiah Stane: If you\\'d killed him when you were supposed to, you\\'d still have a face.\\nRaza: You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.\\nShow me the weapon.\\nCome. Leave your guards outside.\\nHis escape bore unexpected fruit.\\nSo this is how he did it.\\nThis is only a first, crude effort.\\nStark has perfected his design.\\nHe has made a masterpiece of death.\\nA man with a dozen of these\\ncan rule all of Asia.\\nAnd you dream of Stark\\'s throne.\\nWe have a common enemy.\\nIf we are still in business,\\nI will give you these designs\\nas a gift.\\nAnd in turn,\\nI hope you\\'ll repay me with\\na gift of iron soldiers.\\nTechnology.\\nIt\\'s always been your Achilles\\' heel\\nin this part of the world.\\nDon\\'t worry. It\\'ll only last for 15 minutes.\\nThat\\'s the least of your problems.\\nCrate up the armor and the rest of it.\\nAll right, let\\'s finish up here.\\nSet up Sector underneath the arc reactor,\\nand I\\'m going to want this data masked.\\nRecruit our top engineers.\\nI want a prototype right away.\\nTony Stark: Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You\\'re going to hack into the mainframe and you\\'re going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This\\'ll get you in. It\\'s probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.\\nPepper Potts: And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?\\nTony Stark: Same drill. They\\'ve been dealing under the table, and I\\'m going to stop them. I\\'m going to find my weapons and destroy them.\\nPepper Potts: Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you\\'re going to start all of this again.\\nTony Stark: There is nothing except this. There\\'s no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.\\nPepper Potts: Is that so? Well, then, I quit.\\nTony Stark: You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I\\'m trying to protect the people that I put in harm\\'s way, you\\'re going to walk out?\\nPepper Potts: You\\'re going to kill yourself, Tony. I\\'m not going to be a part of it.\\nTony Stark: I shouldn\\'t be alive, unless it was for a reason. I\\'m not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it\\'s right.\\nPepper Potts: You\\'re all I have, too, you know. Sector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah?\\nVideo Voice Over: You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark. As you can see, Obadiah Stane...\\nPepper Potts: Oh, my God.\\nVideo Voice Over: ... your deception and lies will cost you dearly. The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.\\nObadiah Stane: So, what are we going to do about this? I know what you\\'re going through, Pepper. Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn\\'t he? I was so happy when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead. Now I realize, well, Tony never really did come home, did he? He left a part of himself in that cave. Breaks my heart.\\nPepper Potts: Well, he\\'s a complicated person.\\nObadiah Stane: He\\'s been through a lot. I think he\\'ll be all right. You are a very rare woman. Tony doesn\\'t know how lucky he is.\\nPepper Potts: Thank you. Thanks. I\\'d better get back there.\\nObadiah Stane: Is that today\\'s paper?\\nPepper Potts: Yes.\\nObadiah Stane: Do you mind?\\nPepper Potts: Not at all.\\nObadiah Stane: Puzzle.\\nOf course.\\nTake care.\\nAgent Coulson: Ms. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment?\\nPepper Potts: Nope, right now. Come with me.\\nAgent Coulson: Right now?\\nPepper Potts: We\\'re going to have it right now. Yeah, walk with me.\\nAgent Coulson: Okay.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'m going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office.\\nYeah, we\\'ve been working our best to do it.\\nAbsolutely, we\\'re...\\nI\\'m going to have to call you back.\\nMr. Stane? Sir, we\\'ve explored what you\\'ve asked us, and it seems\\nas though there\\'s a little hiccup.\\n- Actually...\\n- A hiccup?\\nYes, to power the suit, sir,\\nthe technology actually doesn\\'t exist.\\n- So, it\\'s...\\n- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?\\nWilliam, here is the technology.\\nI\\'ve asked you to simply make it smaller.\\nOkay, sir, and that\\'s what we\\'re trying\\nto do, but honestly, it\\'s impossible.\\nObadiah Stane: Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!\\nWell, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m not Tony Stark.\\nPepper Potts: Tony? Tony, are you there? Hello?\\nObadiah Stane: Breathe. Easy, easy. You remember this one, right? It\\'s a shame the government didn\\'t approve it. There\\'s so many applications for causing short-term paralysis. Tony. When I ordered the hit on you, I worried that I was killing the golden goose. But, you see, it was just fate that you survived that. You had one last golden egg to give. Do you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you? Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb. Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you? Oh, it\\'s beautiful. Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony. What a masterpiece. Look at that. This is your legacy. A new generation of weapons with this at its heart. Weapons that will help steer the world back on course, put the balance of power in our hands. The right hands. I wish you could\\'ve seen my prototype. It\\'s not as... Well, not as conservative as yours. Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this. I would have preferred that she lived.\\nJames Rhodes: What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed? Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah... Okay, where\\'s Tony now?\\nPepper Potts: I don\\'t know. He\\'s not answering his phone. Please go over there and make sure everything\\'s okay. Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.\\nTony Stark: Good boy.\\nJames Rhodes: Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony! Tony! You okay?\\nTony Stark: Where\\'s Pepper?\\nJames Rhodes: She\\'s fine. She\\'s with five agents. They\\'re about to arrest Obadiah.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s not going to be enough.\\nPepper Potts: Section 16. Section 16. There it is. My key\\'s not working. It\\'s not opening the door. Oh, wow! What\\'s that? It\\'s, like, a little device. It\\'s, like, a thing that\\'s going to pick the lock?\\nAgent Coulson: You might want to take a few steps back.\\nJames Rhodes: That\\'s the coolest thing I\\'ve ever seen.\\nTony Stark: Not bad, huh? Let\\'s do it.\\nJames Rhodes: You need me to do anything else?\\nTony Stark: Keep the skies clear.\\nJames Rhodes: Damn! Next time, baby.\\nLooks like you were right. He was building a suit.\\nI thought it\\'d be bigger.\\nTony Stark: How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?\\nJARVIS: The suit\\'s at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.\\nTony Stark: Keep me posted. Pepper!\\nPepper Potts: Tony! Tony, are you okay?\\nTony Stark: I\\'m fine. How are...\\nPepper Potts: Obadiah, he\\'s gone insane!\\nTony Stark: I know. Listen, you\\'d better get out of there.\\nPepper Potts: He built a suit.\\nTony Stark: Get out of there right now!\\nWhere do you think you\\'re going?\\nYour services are no longer required.\\nStane!\\nI love this suit!\\n- Put them down!\\nObadiah Stane: Collateral damage, Tony.\\nDivert power to chest RT.\\nPower reduced to 19%.\\nLady!\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no!\\nFor 30 years, I\\'ve been holding you up!\\nI built this company from nothing!\\nNothing is going to stand in my way.\\nLeast of all you!\\nImpressive!\\nYou\\'ve upgraded your armor!\\nI\\'ve made some upgrades of my own!\\nJARVIS: Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.\\nTony Stark: Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.\\nJARVIS: With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that--\\nTony Stark: I know the math! Do it!\\nSir, you\\'re not going to believe this.\\nThat thing is back.\\nGet me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!\\nJames Rhodes: Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise.\\nYes, sir.\\nJARVIS: Thirteen percent power, sir.\\nTony Stark: Climb!\\nJARVIS: Eleven percent.\\nTony Stark: Keep going!\\nJARVIS: Seven percent power.\\nTony Stark: Just leave it on the screen!\\nStop telling me!\\nObadiah Stane: You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!\\nTony Stark: How\\'d you solve the icing problem?\\nObadiah Stane: Icing problem?\\nTony Stark: Might want to look into it.\\nJARVIS: Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power.\\nTony Stark: Potts!\\nPepper Potts: Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?\\nTony Stark: I\\'m almost out of power. I\\'ve got to get out of this thing. I\\'ll be right there.\\nNice try!\\n- Weapons status?\\n- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.\\nFlares!\\nVery clever, Tony.\\nTony Stark: Potts?\\nPepper Potts: Tony!\\nTony Stark: This isn\\'t working. We\\'re going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.\\nPepper Potts: Well, how are you going to do that?\\nTony Stark: You\\'re going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I\\'ll let you know. You\\'re going to hit the master bypass button. It\\'s going to fry everything up here.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. I\\'m going in now.\\nTony Stark: Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I\\'ll buy you some time. This looks important!\\nObadiah Stane: I never had a taste for this sort of thing, but I must admit, I\\'m deeply enjoying the suit! You finally outdid yourself, Tony! You\\'d have made your father proud!\\nPepper Potts: It\\'s ready, Tony! Get off the roof! Tony!\\nObadiah Stane: How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!\\nTony Stark: Pepper!\\nObadiah Stane: And now I\\'m going to kill you with it! You ripped out my targeting system!\\nTony Stark: Time to hit the button!\\nPepper Potts: You told me not to!\\nObadiah Stane: Hold still, you little prick!\\nTony Stark: Just do it!\\nPepper Potts: You\\'ll die!\\nTony Stark: Push it!\\nPepper Potts: Tony!\\nYou\\'ve all received the official statement of what occurred at Stark Industries last night. There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor. Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark\\'s personal security staff...\\nTony Stark: \"Iron Man.\" That\\'s kind of catchy.\\nIt\\'s got a nice ring to it. I mean, it\\'s not technically accurate. The suit\\'s a gold-titanium alloy, but it\\'s kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.\\nAgent Coulson: Here\\'s your alibi.\\nOkay.\\nAgent Coulson: You were on your yacht.\\nYeah.\\nAgent Coulson: We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.\\nTony Stark: See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island.\\nAgent Coulson: That\\'s what happened.\\nAll right.\\nAgent Coulson: Just read it, word for word.\\nTony Stark: There\\'s nothing about Stane here.\\nAgent Coulson: That\\'s being handled. He\\'s on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.\\nTony Stark: But what about the whole cover story that it\\'s a bodyguard? He\\'s my... I mean, is that... That\\'s kind of flimsy, don\\'t you think?\\nAgent Coulson: This isn\\'t my first rodeo, Mr. Stark. Just stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you.\\nYou\\'ve got 90 seconds.\\nPepper Potts: Agent Coulson? I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.\\nAgent Coulson: That\\'s what we do. You\\'ll be hearing from us.\\nPepper Potts: From the Strategic Homeland...\\nAgent Coulson: Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nPepper Potts: Right. Let\\'s get this show on the road.\\nTony Stark: You know, it\\'s actually not that bad. Even I don\\'t think I\\'m Iron Man.\\nPepper Potts: You\\'re not Iron Man.\\nTony Stark:  Am so.\\nPepper Potts: You\\'re not.\\nTony Stark:  All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I\\'d have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She\\'d be a wreck, \\'cause she\\'d always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I\\'d become. She\\'d be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night.\\nPepper Potts: What night?\\nTony Stark: You know.\\nPepper Potts: Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you\\'re talking about? Thought so. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\\nTony Stark: Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.\\nJames Rhodes: And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement. He will not be taking any questions.\\nTony Stark: Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I\\'ll stick to the cards this time. There\\'s been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...\\nChristine Everhart: I\\'m sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you...\\nTony Stark: I know that it\\'s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I\\'m a superhero.\\nChristine Everhart: I never said you were a superhero.\\nTony Stark: Didn\\'t? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I\\'m just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I\\'ve made, largely public. \\nJames Rhodes: Just stick to the cards, man.\\nTony Stark: Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man.\\n[After end-credits. Tony reaches home]\\nTony Stark: Jarvis!\\nJARVIS: [distorted] Welcome home, Sir. [Jarvis cuts out]\\nNick Fury: \"I am Iron Man.\" You think you\\'re the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you\\'ve become part of a bigger universe. You just don\\'t know it yet.\\nTony Stark: Who the hell are you?\\nNick Fury: [appears in light] Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nTony Stark: [nonchalantly] Ah.\\nNick Fury: I\\'m here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative.'"

This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you\\'re going to pull over and snuff me. What, you\\'re not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!\\nSoldier: We can talk, sir.\\nTony Stark: Oh, I see. So it\\'s personal?\\nSoldier (female): [She\\'s driving the Vehicle.] No, you intimidate them.\\nTony Stark: Good God, you\\'re a woman. I honestly... I couldn\\'t have called that. I mean, I\\'d apologize, but isn\\'t that what we\\'re going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.\\nSoldier (female): I\\'m an airman.\\nTony Stark: Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I\\'m kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird? [The Soldiers in the vehicle laugh and chuckle.] Come on, it\\'s okay, laugh.\\nSoldier: Sir, I have a question to ask.\\nTony Stark: Yes, please.\\nSoldier: Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year\\'s Maxim cover models?\\nTony Stark: That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else? [The Soldier next to him, Jimmy, raises his hand.] You\\'re kidding me with the hand up, right?\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Is it cool if I take a picture with you?\\nTony Stark: Yes. It\\'s very cool. [The soldier next to him pulls his camera out and hands it to the soldier in the front seat.] I don\\'t want to see this on your MySpace page. [The Soldier puts up a peace sign for the photo.] Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I\\'m kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I\\'d be out of a job with peace.\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don\\'t change any settings. Just click it.\\n[As the picture was about to be taken, something hit and blew up the vehicle in front of them. Gunshots and such were heard and hitting the side of their vehicle.]\\nTony Stark: What\\'s going on?\\nSoldier (female): Contact left!\\nTony Stark: What have we got?\\n[The driver stepped out to go into combat and was shot down]\\nSoldier: Jimmy, stay with Stark!\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Stay down!\\nTony Stark: Yeah.\\n[The other Soldier from the front seat got out to shoot but was shot too]\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Son of a bitch!\\n[Jimmy goes out to fight.]\\nTony Stark: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!\\nSoldier (Jimmy): Stay here!\\n[Jimmy turned back around and he was gunned down too, holes piercing the vehicle. Tony\\'s hearing and senses were dulled a bit as he got himself out of the vehicle, stumbling a bit in the chaos. He got some of his hearing back and ran and dove behind a rock for cover. He pulled out his phone to contact and call for help when a bomb landed next to him. He looked over to see it say: Stark Industries. He tried to get up and get away, but didn\\'t in time. The bomb exploded and made him fly through the air a bit.]\\nTony Stark: Whoa!\\n[He hit the ground hard, senses dulled again. He felt a pain in his chest and pulled his shirt of out the way as blood started to pool.]\\n\\n\\nVoice over: Tony Stark. Visionary. Genius. American patriot. Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT. Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark\\'s lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder, until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries. With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father\\'s legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe.\\nJames Rhodes: As liaison to Stark Industries, I\\'ve had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year\\'s Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark. Tony?\\nObadiah Stane: Thank you, Colonel.\\nJames Rhodes: Thanks for the save.\\nObadiah Stane: This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This is wonderful. Well, I\\'m not Tony Stark. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know...The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He\\'s always working.\\n\\n\\nTony Stark: Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.\\nJames Rhodes: You are unbelievable.\\nTony Stark: Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?\\nJames Rhodes: Nobody roped me into anything!\\nTony Stark: I\\'m so sorry.\\nJames Rhodes: But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you\\'d be deeply honored.\\nTony Stark: Of course I\\'d be deeply honored. And it\\'s you, that\\'s great. So, when do we do it?\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s right here. Here you go.\\nTony Stark: There it is. That was easy. I\\'m so sorry.\\nJames Rhodes: Yeah, it\\'s okay.\\nTony Stark: Wow! Would you look at that? That\\'s something else. I don\\'t have any of those floating around. Uh, we\\'re gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something. [hot girl blows on dice] Okay, you, too. [Tony holds the dice out to Rhodes.]\\nJames Rhodes: I don\\'t blow on a man\\'s dice.\\nTony Stark: Come on, honey bear.\\nJames Rhodes: I don\\'t blow on a man\\'s dice. [Rhodes knocks Tony\\'s hand away causing the dice to roll]\\nTony Stark: There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...\\nDealer: Two craps. Line away.\\nJames Rhodes: That\\'s what happens.\\nTony Stark: Worse things have happened. I think we\\'re gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?\\n[Tony, Rhodes, and Happy leaving the casino.]\\nJames Rhodes: This is where I exit.\\nTony Stark: All right.\\nJames Rhodes: Tomorrow, don\\'t be late.\\nTony Stark: Yeah, you can count on it.\\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m serious!\\nTony Stark: I know, I know. [Handing over his award to Caesar.] Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar\\'s. There you go.\\n[Outside of the casino.]\\nChristine Everhart: Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark! Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?\\nHappy Hogan: [whispering to Tony] She\\'s cute. \\nTony Stark: She\\'s all right? [Turns to face Christine.] Hi.\\nChristine Everhart: Hi.\\nTony Stark: Yeah. Okay-- \\nChristine Everhart: It\\'s okay? \\nTony Stark: Go.\\nChristine Everhart: You\\'ve been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?\\nTony Stark: Absolutely ridiculous. I don\\'t paint.\\nChristine Everhart: And what do you say to your other nickname? \"The Merchant of Death\"?\\nTony Stark: That\\'s not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?\\nChristine Everhart: Brown, actually.\\nTony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It\\'s an imperfect world, but it\\'s the only one we\\'ve got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I\\'ll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.\\nChristine Everhart: You rehearse that much?\\nTony Stark: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.\\nChristine Everhart: I can see that.\\nTony Stark: I\\'d like to show you first-hand.\\nChristine Everhart: All I want is a serious answer.\\nTony Stark: Okay, here\\'s serious. My old man had a philosophy, \"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.\"\\nChristine Everhart: That\\'s a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.\\nTony Stark: My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.\\nChristine Everhart: And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.\\nTony Stark: Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we\\'ve saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.\\nChristine Everhart: You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?\\nTony Stark: I\\'d be prepared to lose a few with you.\\n[They go to Malibu and have sex.]\\nJARVIS: Good morning. It\\'s 7:00 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds. The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines. High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.\\nChristine Everhart: [Walking around Tony\\'s mansion.] Tony? Hey, Tony? [Tries to play with the controls on the wall. It beeps at her.]\\nJARVIS: You are not authorized to access this area.\\nChristine Everhart: Jesus.\\nPepper Potts: That\\'s JARVIS. He runs the house. I\\'ve got your clothes here. They\\'ve been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there\\'s a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you\\'d like to go.\\nChristine Everhart: You must be the famous Pepper Potts.\\nPepper Potts: Indeed I am.\\nChristine Everhart: After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning.\\nPepper Potts: I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?\\n\\n\\n[Tony working on a car in his workshop]\\nTony Stark: Give me an exploded view. \\nJARVIS: The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.\\nTony Stark: Log that.\\nPepper Potts: [Coming in on her phone.] I\\'m gonna try again, right now.\\nTony Stark: Please don\\'t turn down my music.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'ll keep you posted. [Getting off the phone.] You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.\\nTony Stark: How\\'d she take it?\\nPepper Potts: Like a champ.\\nTony Stark: Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?\\nPepper Potts: Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.\\nPepper Potts: Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door.\\nTony Stark: I mean, doesn\\'t it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?\\nPepper Potts: Larry called. He\\'s got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.\\nTony Stark: Is it a good representation of his spring period?\\nPepper Potts: Um, no. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked-- \\nTony Stark: So?\\nPepper Potts: --not \"spring\" like the season. I think it\\'s a fair example. Um.. I think it\\'s incredibly overpriced.\\nTony Stark: I need it. Buy it. Store it.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. The MIT commencement speech...\\nTony Stark: Is in June. Please, don\\'t harangue me about stuff that\\'s way, way, down...\\nPepper Potts: Well, they\\'re haranguing me, so I\\'m gonna say yes.\\nTony Stark: Deflect it and absorb it. Don\\'t transmit it back to me.\\nPepper Potts: I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.\\nTony Stark: What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?\\nPepper Potts: As a matter of fact, I do.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t like it when you have plans.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'m allowed to have plans on my birthday.\\nTony Stark: It\\'s your birthday?\\nPepper Potts: Yes.\\nTony Stark: I knew that. Already?\\nPepper Potts: Yeah. Isn\\'t that strange? It\\'s the same day as last year.\\nTony Stark: Well, get yourself something nice from me.\\nPepper Potts: I already did.\\nTony Stark: And?\\nPepper Potts: Oh, it was very nice.\\nTony Stark: Yeah.\\nPepper Potts: Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.\\nTony Stark: You\\'re welcome, Miss Potts... Okay.\\n\\n\\n[Happy and Tony racing to the airport and arriving.]\\nTony Stark: You\\'re good. I thought I lost you back there.\\nHappy: You did, sir. [Grabbing Tony\\'s things from the trunk.] I had to cut across Mulholland.\\nTony Stark: I got you. I got you.\\nJames Rhodes: What\\'s wrong with you? [Standing at the jet doorway.]\\nTony Stark: What?\\nJames Rhodes: Three hours.\\nTony Stark: I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.\\nJames Rhodes: For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.\\nTony Stark: Waiting on you now. Let\\'s go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll! \\n\\n\\n[inside the jet.]\\nTony Stark: What you reading, platypus?\\nJames Rhodes: Nothing.\\nTony Stark: Come on, sour patch. \\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m not sour.\\nTony Stark: Don\\'t be mad.\\nJames Rhodes: I told you, I\\'m not mad. I\\'m indifferent, okay?\\nTony Stark: I said I was sorry.\\nFlight Attendant #1: Good morning, Mr. Stark.\\nJames Rhodes: You don\\'t need to apologize to me. \\nTony Stark: I told you I was sorry.\\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m your man.\\nTony Stark: Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...\\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m just indifferent right now. \\nFlight Attendant #1: Hot towel?\\nJames Rhodes: You don\\'t respect yourself, so I know you don\\'t respect me.\\nTony Stark: I respect you.\\nJames Rhodes: I\\'m just your babysitter. So, when you need your diaper changed... [grabs a hot towel] Thank you. Let me know and I\\'ll get you a bottle, okay?\\nTony Stark: Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me.\\nJames Rhodes: No, I\\'m not talking... We\\'re not drinking. We\\'re working right now.\\nTony Stark: You can\\'t have sashimi without sake.\\nJames Rhodes: You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.\\nTony Stark: It would be irresponsible not to drink. I\\'m just talking about a nightcap.\\nFlight Attendant #2: Hot sake?\\nTony Stark: Yes, two, please.\\nJames Rhodes: No. Just-- I\\'m not drinking. I don\\'t want any.\\n\\n\\n[Rhodes and Tony drunk on the couch and the flight attendants dancing around them.]\\nJames Rhodes: That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. When I get up in the morning and I\\'m putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that\\'s got this uniform on got my back!\\nTony Stark: Hey, you know what? I\\'m not like you. I\\'m not cut out...\\nJames Rhodes: No, no. You don\\'t have to be like me! But you\\'re more than what you are.\\nTony Stark: Can you excuse me if I\\'m a bit distracted here?\\nJames Rhodes: No! You can\\'t be distracted right now! Listen to me!\\n\\n\\n[Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan.]\\nTony Stark: General.\\nGeneral: Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.\\nTony Stark: Thanks.\\n\\n\\n[Tony giving his presentation in the desert of Afghanistan.]\\nTony Stark: Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries\\' Freedom Line. It\\'s the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That\\'s how Dad did it. That\\'s how America does it. And it\\'s worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won\\'t even want to come out of their caves. [The missiles get launched.] For your consideration, the Jericho. [The missiles explode]\\n\\n\\nTony Stark: [Opening a cooler full of alcohol]I\\'ll be throwing one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more. To peace! [Tony\\'s phone begins ringing.]\\nObadiah Stane: [through the video chat] Tony.\\nTony Stark: Obie, what are you doing up?\\nObadiah Stane: I couldn\\'t sleep till I found out how it went. How\\'d it go?\\nTony Stark: It went great. Looks like it\\'s gonna be an early Christmas.\\nObadiah Stane: Hey! Way to go, my boy! I\\'ll see you tomorrow, yeah?\\nTony Stark: Why aren\\'t you wearing those pajamas I got you?\\nObadiah Stane: Good night, Tony. [Tony hangs up the call as he enters the military vehicle.]\\nJames Rhodes: Hey, Tony. [Coming up to the vehicle Tony\\'s in.]\\nTony Stark:  I\\'m sorry, this is the \"fun-vee.\" The \"hum-drum-vee\" is back there.\\nJames Rhodes: Nice job.\\nTony Stark: See you back at base.\\n\\n\\n[Replay of the attack in the first scene mixed with Tony have surgery and screaming. Tony wakes up suddenly with a tube up his nose, laying on a cot in a cave. He rips out the tube and tries to pick up a cup on the table beside him, but fails. He notices a man shaving and tries to reach further but is stopped by wires.]\\nYinsen: I wouldn\\'t do that if I were you.\\n[Tony realizes that he\\'s connected to a battery. He rips off the bandages over his chest to see an electromagnet inside his chest]\\n\\n\\n[Yinsen and Tony sitting by a small fire. Yinsen is making food while Tony is using a mirror to look at his chest.]\\nTony Stark: What the hell did you do to me?\\nYinsen: What I did? What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there\\'s a lot left, and it\\'s headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see? [Pulls out a bottle of shrapnel.] I have a souvenir. Take a look. [Tosses the bottle to Tony] I\\'ve seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.\\nTony Stark: What is this?\\nYinsen: That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it\\'s keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. Hmm? [Tony sips up the jacket he\\'s wearing and looks at the camera on the ceiling.] That\\'s right. Smile. We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t remember.\\nYinsen: No, you wouldn\\'t. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn\\'t have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.\\nTony Stark: Where are we?\\n[Loud voices sound from the another side of the metal door as they open it.]\\nYinsen: Come on, stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do. Come on, put your hands up. \\n[Men walk in with guns.]\\nTony Stark: Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?\\nYinsen: Do you understand me? Do as I do. [A man starts speaking in Arabic. Yinsen translates for him.] He says, \"Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer \"in the history of America.\" [Man speaks in Arabic.] He is honored. [Man speaks in Arabic.] He wants you to build the missile. [Man speaks in Arabic.] The Jericho missile that you demonstrated. [Man speaks in Arabic, handing Yinsen a picture of the Jericho missile.] This one.\\nTony Stark:  I refuse. [Tony then is shown with his head in a large thing of water. Flashes of himself and the electromagnet in his chest are shown.]\\nPepper Potts: Tony! [As a voice in his head as he tries not to drown.]\\n[The men pull him out, put a bag over his head, and escort him out of the cave. Tony sees a lot of men, tents, and his guns. The same man speaking Arabic before speaks again.]\\nYinsen: He wants to know what you think.\\nTony Stark: I think you got a lot of my weapons. \\n[Yinsen translates Tony\\'s words into Arabic. The same man speaking Arabic responds]\\nYinsen: He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials. [Man speaks Arabic again] He says for you to start working immediately, and when you\\'re done, he will set you free.\\nTony Stark: No, he won\\'t. [Shaking the Arabic man\\'s hand.]\\nYinsen: No, he won\\'t.\\n\\n\\nYinsen: [Tony sitting around a small fire in the cave with Tony] I\\'m sure they\\'re looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life\\'s work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it?\\nTony Stark: Why should I do anything? They\\'re going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don\\'t, I\\'ll probably be dead in a week.\\nYinsen: Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn\\'t it? Hm?\\nTony Stark: [Directing the men to where to put things while Yinsen\\'s translating] If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up. I need welding gear. I don\\'t care if it\\'s acetylene or propane. I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I\\'m gonna need goggles. I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools. [Yinsen and Tony start taking apart the weapons.] How many languages do you speak?\\nYinsen: A lot. But apparently, not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.\\nTony Stark: Who are these people?\\nYinsen: They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings. [The men of the Ten Rings are shown watching Tony and Yinsen work on a TV.] You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process.\\nTony Stark: Uh-huh. [Tony pulls apart a missile.] Okay, we don\\'t need this.\\nYinsen: What is that?\\nTony Stark: That\\'s palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don\\'t you go break down the other 11?  \\n\\n\\nMan #1: What\\'s he doing? [speaking Arabic]\\nMan #2: Working. [speaking Arabic]\\n[Tony and Yinsen working on something. Yinsen is pulling something out of the fire.]\\nTony Stark: Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.\\nYinsen: Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you\\'re still alive?\\nTony Stark: What do I call you?\\nYinsen: My name is Yinsen.\\nTony Stark: Yinsen. Nice to meet you.\\nYinsen: Nice to meet you, too. [Tony puts together a device while Yinsen watches.] Whoa. That doesn\\'t look like a Jericho missile.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s because it\\'s a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.\\nYinsen: But what could it generate?\\nTony Stark: If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.\\nYinsen: That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.\\nTony Stark: Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.\\n\\n\\nTony Stark: [Looking at sheets of paper with Tony] This is our ticket out of here.\\nYinsen: What is it?\\nTony Stark: Flatten them out and look. [Yinsen flattens the sheets out to see a drawing of a metal suit.]\\nYinsen: Oh, wow. Impressive.\\n[Security footage shows that the arc reactor was successfully put in Tony, allowing him more freedom of movement without having to carry the car battery around.]\\n\\n\\n[Tony and Yinsen playing a game.]\\nYinsen: Good. Good roll. Good roll.\\nTony Stark: You still haven\\'t told me where you\\'re from.\\nYinsen: I\\'m from a small town called Gulmira. It\\'s actually a nice place.\\nTony Stark: Got a family?\\nYinsen: Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?\\nTony Stark: No.\\nYinsen: No? So you\\'re a man who has everything and nothing.\\n[The men of the Ten Rings come to the door, armed. They open the hatch to see Tony and Yinsen working before turning around and leaving. Shows Tony welding metal together, while the Ten Rings watch the cameras and compare what he\\'s creating with the Jericho picture.]\\nMan #1: It doesn\\'t look anything like the picture. [Speaking Arabic]\\nMan #2: Maybe it\\'s been modified. [Speaking Arabic]\\nMan #1: The tail is wrong. [Speaking Arabic]\\nMan #2: It\\'s just backwards. [Speaking Arabic]\\n[The head of the Ten Rings, Raza, watches Tony and Yinsen test out one of the legs of the suit. He and his men go visit Tony and Yinsen.]\\nRaza: Relax. [Motioning for the two men to remove their hands from above their heads. They do so as Raza comes up and inspects Tony\\'s arc reactor.] The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology. It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine. An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman Empire. But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. And soon, it will be my turn. [Starts speaking in Urdu as he stares down Tony.] Why have you failed me?\\nYinsen: We\\'re working. Diligently. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nRaza: [Turns and walks toward Yinsen.] I let you live. This is how you repay me? [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nYinsen: It\\'s very complex. He\\'s trying very hard. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nRaza: On his knees. [He commands his men in Urdu. Yinsen is forced to his knees.] You think I\\'m a fool? I\\'ll get the truth. [Speaking in Urdu as he takes a coal from the dying fire.]\\nYinsen: We\\'re both working. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nRaza: Open your mouth. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nTony Stark: What does he want?\\nRaza: You think I\\'m a fool? What\\'s going on? Tell me the truth. [Speaking in Urdu. Raza forces Yinsen\\'s head to lay on the table.]\\nYinsen: He\\'s building your Jericho. He\\'s building your Jericho. [Speaking in Urdu.]\\nTony Stark: What do you want? A delivery date? [Tony tries to go towards Raza and Yinsen but the other men pull their guns on him.] I need him. Good assistant.\\nRaza: You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile. \\n[Tony is shown hammering the helmet of the suit to shape it. He cools it in water before setting on the table in front of Yinsen. Tony is shown wrapping his hands up and Yinsen lifting the suit up. Yinsen helps Tony suit up.]\\nYinsen: Okay? Can you move? Okay, say it again.\\nTony Stark: 41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that\\'s from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.\\n[Raza notices on the security screens that Stark cannot be seen.]\\nRaza: Where is Stark? [Speaking Arabic]\\nMan: He was here a moment ago. [Speaking Arabic]\\nRaza: Go look for him. [Speaking Arabic]\\n[The men rush to the cell.]\\nMan: Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!\\nTony Stark: Say something. Say something back to him.\\nYinsen: He\\'s speaking Hungarian. I don\\'t...\\nTony Stark: Then speak Hungarian.\\nYinsen: Okay. I know.\\nTony Stark: What do you know? \\n[The men are shouting through the door while Yinsen is shouting something back at them. The door is shown to have an explosive on it. The men try to open the door, only for it to explode. Raza watches this all on camera and orders his men down there.]\\nTony Stark: How\\'d that work?\\nYinsen: Oh, my goodness. It worked all right.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s what I do.\\nYinsen: Let me finish this.\\nTony Stark: Initialize the power sequence.\\nYinsen: Okay.\\nTony Stark: Now!\\nYinsen: Tell me. Tell me. \\nTony Stark: Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now.\\nYinsen: Yes.\\nTony Stark: Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.\\nYinsen: I have it.\\nTony Stark: Press Control \"l\".\\nYinsen: \"I.\" \\nTony Stark: \"I.\" \"Enter.\"\\nYinsen: Got it.\\nTony Stark: \"l\" and \"Enter.\" Come over here and button me up.\\nYinsen: Okay. All right.\\nTony Stark: Every other hex bolt.\\nYinsen: They\\'re coming!\\nTony Stark: Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done.\\nYinsen: They\\'re coming.\\nTony Stark: Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?\\nYinsen: We need more time. Hey, I\\'m gonna go buy you some time.\\nTony Stark: Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan! [Yinsen runs out of the cave with a gun from one of the dead men.] Yinsen! Yinsen!\\n[Tony watches the progress bar move while Yinsen aimlessly shoots the cave walls as he runs, scarring the men. Yinsen is stopped when he reaches the mouth of the cave and a group of men. The progress bar finishes loading, causing the lights to dim, and the suit to be powered. More men arrive in the cave to get Tony. Tony attacks them using the suit. On his way out of the cave, he attacks more of the men. Raza waits at the mouth of the cave. Tony arrives to see Yinsen has been shot.]\\nTony Stark: Yinsen!\\nYinsen: Watch out! [Raza tries to shoot at Tony but misses. Tony shoots back, hitting the wall behind Raza, causing a mini explosion and knocking Raza out.] Stark.\\nTony Stark: Come on. [Tony opens is helmet.] We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We\\'re gonna stick to it.\\nYinsen: This was always the plan, Stark.\\nTony Stark: Come on, you\\'re gonna go see your family. Get up.\\nYinsen: My family is dead. I\\'m going to see them now, Stark. It\\'s okay. I want this. I want this.\\nTony Stark: Thank you for saving me.\\nYinsen: Don\\'t waste it. Don\\'t waste your life.\\n[Yinsen dies. Tony turns angry. There are men waiting outside of the mouth of the cave. They all shoot at Tony in the suit, but don\\'t do any damage.]\\nTony Stark: My turn. [Tony shoots fire at the men and their camp from his suit. The men continue to shoot at Tony, beginning to cause damage to the suit. Tony flips a suit and shoots up in the air. He screams as he falls into the sand on the other side of the mountains. The suit breaks when he lands.] Not bad.\\n[Tony then is seen wondering through the desert, exhausted. Military helicopters fly up from behind him.]\\nTony Stark: Hey! [Waving down the helicopters.] Hey!\\n[As one of the helicopters lands, Tony collapses to his knees, holding up a peace sign. Rhodey and a few men are seen running up to Tony from the helicopter.]\\nJames Rhodes: How was the \"fun-vee\"? Next time, you ride with me, okay?\\n\\n\\n[California Military Base where a giant plane has just landed. Medical, Happy, and Pepper are waiting there. The ramp lowers and Rhodey helps Tony down.]\\nJames Rhodes: Watch it, coming up here.\\nTony Stark: Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them. [Tony walks up to Pepper.] Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?\\nPepper Potts: Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.\\nTony Stark: Yeah, vacation\\'s over.\\n[Tony, Pepper, and Happy get into the car.]\\nHappy: Where to, sir?\\nPepper Potts: Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.\\nTony Stark: No.\\nPepper Potts: No? Tony, you have to go to the hospital.\\nTony Stark: No is a complete answer.\\nPepper Potts: The doctor has to look at you.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t have to do anything. I\\'ve been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...\\nPepper Potts: That\\'s enough of that.\\nTony Stark: ...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.\\nPepper Potts: Call for a press conference?\\nTony Stark: Yeah.\\nPepper Potts: What on earth for?\\nTony Stark: Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.\\n\\n\\n[Happy driving them up to Stark Industries HQ, where Obadiah is waiting with the press and their employees.]\\nObadiah Stane: Look at this! Tony. We were going to meet at the hospital.\\nTony Stark: No, I\\'m fine.\\nObadiah Stane: Look at you! You had to have a burger, yeah?\\nTony Stark: Well, come on.\\nObadiah Stane: You get me one of those?\\nTony Stark: There\\'s only one left. I need it.\\nObadiah Stane: Hey, look who\\'s here! Yeah!\\nAgent Coulson: Miss Potts?\\nPepper Potts: Yes.\\nAgent Coulson: Can I speak to you for a moment?\\nPepper Potts: I\\'m not part of the press conference, but it\\'s about to begin right now.\\nAgent Coulson: I\\'m not a reporter. I\\'m Agent Phil Coulson, with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.\\nPepper Potts: That\\'s quite a mouthful.\\nAgent Coulson: I know. We\\'re working on it.\\nPepper Potts: You know, we\\'ve been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...\\nAgent Coulson: We\\'re a separate division with a more specific focus. We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'ll put something in the book, shall I?\\nAgent Coulson: Thank you.\\nObadiah Stane: Well, let\\'s get this started, uh...\\nTony Stark: Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down? [Sitting in front of the podium.] Why don\\'t you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can... A little less formal and... [Tony takes a bite of his cheeseburger as everyone sits, or squats, down]\\nJames Rhodes: What\\'s up with the love-in? \\nPepper Potts: Don\\'t look at me. I don\\'t know what he\\'s up to.\\nTony Stark: Good to see you.\\nObadiah Stane: Good to see you.\\nTony Stark: I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There\\'s questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.\\nReporters: Mr. Stark!\\nTony Stark: Hey, Ben.\\nReporter (Ben): What happened over there?\\nTony Stark: I had my eyes opened. [Tony stands and moves behind the podium.] I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International [Everyone stands up in commotion.] until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.\\nObadiah Stane: I think we\\'re gonna be selling a lot of newspapers. [Standing up beside Tony.]\\nTony Stark: What direction it should take, one that I\\'m comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well. [Tony leaves the stage.]\\nObadiah Stane: What we should take away from this is that Tony\\'s back! And he\\'s healthier than ever. We\\'re going to have a little internal discussion and we\\'ll get back to you with the follow-up. [Obadiah is shown on a Segway, riding up to one of the Stark buildings. Happy leaning against a car outside.] Where is he?\\nHappy: He\\'s inside. \\n[Obadiah goes inside to find Tony looking at the giant arc reactor.]\\nObadiah Stane: Well, that..uh... That went well.\\nTony Stark: Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?\\nObadiah Stane: Your head? What about my head? What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?\\nTony Stark: Uh, optimistically, 40 points.\\nObadiah Stane: At minimum.\\nTony Stark: Yep.\\nObadiah Stane: Tony, we\\'re a weapons manufacturer.\\nTony Stark: Obie, I just don\\'t want a body count to be our only legacy.\\nObadiah Stane: That\\'s what we do. We\\'re iron mongers. We make weapons.\\nTony Stark: It\\'s my name on the side of the building.\\nObadiah Stane: And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.\\nTony Stark: Not based on what I saw. We\\'re not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We\\'re gonna do something else.\\nObadiah Stane: Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?\\nTony Stark: I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.\\nObadiah Stane: Ah, come on. The arc reactor, that\\'s a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up.\\nTony Stark: It works.\\nObadiah Stane: Yeah, as a science project. The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology, that\\'s a dead end, right?\\nTony Stark: Maybe.\\nObadiah Stane: Huh? Am I right? We haven\\'t had a breakthrough in that in what? Thirty years.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?\\nObadiah Stane: Never mind who told me. Show me.\\nTony Stark: It\\'s Rhodey or Pepper.\\nObadiah Stane: I want to see it.\\nTony Stark: Okay, Rhodey. [Tony opens his shirt to show Obadiah the reactor in his chest.]\\nObadiah Stane: Okay. [Obadiah begins to button Tony\\'s shirt back up.]\\nTony Stark: Okay? It works.\\nObadiah Stane: Listen to me, Tony. We\\'re a team. Do you understand? There\\'s nothing we can\\'t do if we stick together, like your father and I.\\nTony Stark: I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had...\\nObadiah Stane: Tony. Tony, no more of this \"ready, fire, aim\" business. You understand me?\\nTony Stark: That was Dad\\'s line.\\nObadiah Stane: You gotta let me handle this. We\\'re gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now. We\\'re going to have to take a lot of heat. I want you to promise me that you\\'re gonna lay low.\\n\\n\\n[Stark Mansion, where Pepper is watching the news.]\\nNewcaster: Stark Industries! I\\'ve got one recommendation! Ready? Ready? Sell, sell, sell! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan! Look, that\\'s a weapons company that doesn\\'t make weapons!\\nTony Stark: [Over the intercoms] Pepper. How big are your hands?\\nPepper Potts: What?\\nTony Stark: How big are your hands?\\nPepper Potts: I don\\'t understand why...\\nTony Stark: Get down here. I need you. [Pepper enters Tony\\'s workshop to find Tony lying shirtless on a chair.] Hey. Let\\'s see them. Show me your hands. Let\\'s see them. [Pepper holds up her hands as she comes closer.] Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec.\\nPepper Potts: Oh, my God, is that the thing that\\'s keeping you alive?\\nTony Stark: It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I\\'m swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.\\nPepper Potts: Speed bump, what does that mean?\\nTony Stark: It\\'s nothing. It\\'s just a little snag. There\\'s an exposed wire under this device. And it\\'s contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It\\'s fine. [Tony pulls out the old device, handing it to Pepper.]\\nPepper Potts: What do you want me to do?\\nTony Stark: Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.\\nPepper Potts: Oh, my God! [Setting the old reactor on the table.]\\nTony Stark: I want you to reach in, and you\\'re just gonna gently lift the wire out.\\nPepper Potts: Is it safe?\\nTony Stark: Yeah, it should be fine. It\\'s like Operation. You just don\\'t let it touch the socket wall or it goes \"beep.\"\\nPepper Potts: What do you mean, \"Operation\"?\\nTony Stark: It\\'s just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire. \\nPepper Potts: Okay.\\nTony Stark: Okay? Great.\\nPepper Potts: You know, I don\\'t think that I\\'m qualified to do this.\\nTony Stark: No, you\\'re fine. You\\'re the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I\\'ve ever met. You\\'re gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? \\'Cause I\\'m...\\nPepper Potts: Okay, okay.\\nTony Stark: I really need your help here.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. [Slides her hand into the hole in Tony\\'s chest.] Oh, there\\'s pus!\\nTony Stark: It\\'s not pus. It\\'s an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body.\\nPepper Potts: It smells!\\nTony Stark: Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?\\nPepper Potts: Okay, I got it! I got it!\\nTony Stark: Okay, you got it? Now, don\\'t let it touch [Pepper lets it touch the side.] the sides when you\\'re coming out!\\nPepper Potts: I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don\\'t... [Pepper pulls out the wire with the magnet attached and the medical equipment starts beeping.] There\\'s a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.\\nPepper Potts: Oh, God!\\nTony Stark: Okay, I was not expecting... \\nPepper Potts: Okay, what do I do?\\nTony Stark: Don\\'t put it back in! Don\\'t put it back in!\\nPepper Potts: What\\'s wrong?\\nTony Stark: Nothing, I\\'m just going into cardiac arrest-- \\nPepper Potts: What? You said it was safe!\\nTony Stark: \\'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. Okay. Tony? \\nTony Stark: What?\\nPepper Potts: It\\'s going to be okay. Okay?\\nTony Stark: Is it?\\nPepper Potts: It\\'s gonna be okay. I\\'m gonna make this okay.\\nTony Stark: Let\\'s hope. Okay, you\\'re gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you... [Screams went it attaches.] Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice.\\nPepper Potts: Are you okay?\\nTony Stark: Yeah, I feel great. You okay?\\nPepper Potts: Don\\'t ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t have anyone but you. Anyway... [Tony rips on the wires off and stands up.]\\nPepper Potts: What do you want me to do with this? [Holding Tony\\'s old reactor.]\\nTony Stark: That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.\\nPepper Potts: You don\\'t want to keep it?\\nTony Stark: Pepper, I\\'ve been called many things. \"Nostalgic\" is not one of them.\\nPepper Potts: Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\\nTony Stark: That will be all, Miss Potts. [Turns to talk to his robot while he eyes Pepper as she walks away.] Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What\\'s all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That\\'s my phone, that\\'s a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.\\n\\n\\n[Air Force Base where Rhodes is guiding a group of people through the hanger.]\\nJames Rhodes: The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I\\'ll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot\\'s instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot\\'s judgment.\\nTony Stark: Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?\\nJames Rhodes: Look who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.\\nMan: Hello, sir. \\nTony Stark: Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with.\\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that!\\nTony Stark: What was his name?\\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that.\\nTony Stark: Was it Ivan?\\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that. They\\'ll believe it. \\nTony Stark: Okay.\\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that.\\nTony Stark: Okay.  \\nJames Rhodes: Don\\'t do that.\\nTony Stark: Pleasure meeting you.\\nJames Rhodes: Give us a couple minutes, you guys. [The group walks off.] I\\'m surprised.\\nTony Stark: Why?\\nJames Rhodes: I swear, I didn\\'t expect to see you walking around so soon.\\nTony Stark: I\\'m doing a little better than walking.\\nJames Rhodes: Really?\\nTony Stark: Yeah. Rhodey, I\\'m working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.\\nJames Rhodes: You\\'re about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, \\'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy.\\nTony Stark: This is not for the military. I\\'m not... It\\'s different.\\nJames Rhodes: What? You\\'re a humanitarian now or something?\\nTony Stark: I need you to listen to me.\\nJames Rhodes: No. What you need is time to get your mind right. I\\'m serious.\\nTony Stark: Okay.\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s nice seeing you, Tony. [Rhodey walks off.]\\nTony Stark: Thanks.\\n\\n\\n[Tony in his workshop, working on his computer and hologram table.]\\nTony Stark: JARVIS, you up?\\nJARVIS: For you, sir, always.\\nTony Stark: I\\'d like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two.\\nJARVIS: Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?\\nTony Stark: Actually, I don\\'t know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don\\'t we just keep everything on my private server?\\nJARVIS: Working on a secret project, are we, sir?\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.\\n\\n\\n[men from the Ten Rings searching the desert for Tony\\'s suit. Shows that part of Raza\\'s face was burned]\\n\\n\\n[Tony working on a boot for the new suit in his workshop. His robot, Dummy, is assisting him.]\\nTony Stark: Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You\\'re of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I\\'m sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don\\'t even move. You are a tragedy.\\n\\n\\n[Tony wearing the boots in his workshop for a test flight. One of the robots is filming it, while Dummy is in charge of the fire extinguisher.]\\nTony Stark: Okay, let\\'s do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You\\'re on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We\\'re gonna start off nice and easy. We\\'re gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one. \\n[Tony immediately flings back and hits the upper wall. Dummy uses the fire extinguisher on him. Tony is then seen working on flight stabilizers for his hands/arms. While he\\'s working, Pepper comes in with a wrapped box and a cup of something.]\\nTony Stark: Up two. All right, set that.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'ve been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?\\nTony Stark: Yeah, everything\\'s... What? [Still distracted with the flight stabilizer.]\\nPepper Potts: Obadiah\\'s upstairs.\\nTony Stark: Great!\\nPepper Potts: What would you like me to tell him?\\nTony Stark: Great. I\\'ll be right up.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. I thought you said you were done making weapons.\\nTony Stark: It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It\\'s completely harmless. [The stabilizer shoots, flinging Tony backwards and scaring Pepper.] I didn\\'t expect that. [Tony then comes up stairs to find Obadiah playing the piano and Pepper working on the couch.] How\\'d it go? It went that bad, huh?\\nObadiah Stane: Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn\\'t mean it went bad. [Still playing the piano.]\\nTony Stark: Sure doesn\\'t. Oh, boy.\\nObadiah Stane: It would have gone better if you were there.\\nTony Stark: Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That\\'s what I\\'ve been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all...\\nObadiah Stane: Hey, come on. In public. The press. [Comes over to sit next to Tony.] This was a board of directors meeting.\\nTony Stark: This was a board of directors meeting?\\nObadiah Stane: The board is claiming you have post-traumatic stress. They\\'re filing an injunction.\\nTony Stark: A what?\\nObadiah Stane: They want to lock you out.\\nTony Stark: Why, \\'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen.\\nPepper Potts: Fifty-six and a half.\\nTony Stark: It doesn\\'t matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.\\nObadiah Stane: Tony, the board has rights, too. They\\'re making the case that you and your new direction isn\\'t in the company\\'s best interest.\\nTony Stark: I\\'m being responsible! That\\'s a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company\\'s behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great. [Tony stands up, taking the pizza box with him. Obadiah follows.]\\nObadiah Stane: Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.\\nTony Stark: I\\'ll be in the shop.\\nObadiah Stane: Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen. I\\'m trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them. Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs.\\nTony Stark: No. No, absolutely not.\\nObadiah Stane: It\\'ll give me a bone to throw the boys in New York!\\nTony Stark: This one stays with me. That\\'s it, Obie. Forget it.\\nObadiah Stane: All right, well, this stays with me, then. [Obadiah takes the pizza box back.] Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two.\\nTony Stark: Thank you.\\nObadiah Stane: You mind if I come down there and see what you\\'re doing?\\nTony Stark: Good night, Obie. [Tony heads back down to his workshop]\\n\\n\\nTony Stark: [running another flight test, this time wearing the boots and hand flight stabilizers] Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again, and I\\'m not on fire, I\\'m donating you to a city college. All right, nice and easy. Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three, two, one. [Lifts off the ground and hovers for a bit before landing.] Okay. Please don\\'t follow me around with it, either, \\'cause I feel like I\\'m gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down! If something happens, then come in. And again, let\\'s bring it up to 2.5. Three, two, one. [Lifts off the ground with less control and starts hovering all over the workshop.] Okay, this is where I don\\'t want to be! Not the car, not the car! Table! Could be worse! Could be worse! We\\'re fine! Okay. [Lands where he started. Dummy goes to use the fire extinguisher.] No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly.\\n\\n\\n[Tony fully suiting up in the Mark II.]\\nTony Stark: JARVIS, are you there?\\nJARVIS: At your service, sir.\\nTony Stark: Engage heads-up display.\\nJARVIS: Check.\\nTony Stark: Import all preferences from home interface.\\nJARVIS: Will do, sir.\\nTony Stark: All right, what do you say?\\nJARVIS: I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We\\'re online and ready.\\nTony Stark: Can we start the virtual walk-around?\\nJARVIS: Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.\\nTony Stark: Do a check on control surfaces\\nJARVIS: As you wish. [The full suit is shown.] Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.\\nTony Stark: Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control.\\nJARVIS: Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is...\\nTony Stark: JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one. [Begins hovering and flies out of the garage into the sky.] Handles like a dream. All right, let\\'s see what this thing can do. What\\'s SR-71\\'s record?\\nJARVIS: The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.\\nTony Stark: Records are made to be broken! Come on! [Begins flying straight up.]\\nJARVIS: Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.\\nTony Stark: Keep going! Higher! [Ice builds up around the suit, causing it to stop working and him to start flying from the sky.] We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice! \\n[Tony manually gets the flaps up. The power starts just it time before he crashes into traffic. He heads back to the mansion and hovers above it, hoping to safely land on the roof.]\\nTony Stark: Kill power. \\n[Power is killed and Tony falls through the roof, the piano, and down into his workshop, landing on top of a car. Dummy uses the fire extinguisher on him]\\n\\n\\n[Tony out of the suit, walking around the workshop with an ice pack on his head. He picks up the cup that Pepper left earlier and notices the package she left. On top, it has a sticky note saying \\'from Pepper\\'. He takes it off and opens the package.]\\nNotes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude.\\nHull pressurization is problematic. I\\'m thinking icing is the probable factor.\\nJARVIS: A very astute observation, sir.\\nPerhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.\\nConnect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals.\\nUse the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite.\\nThat should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.\\n- Got it?\\n- Yes.\\nShall I render using proposed specifications?\\nThrill me.\\nTV Reporter: Tonight\\'s red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark\\'s third annual benefit\\nfor the Firefighter\\'s Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.\\'s high society.\\nTony Stark: JARVIS, we get an invite for that?\\nJARVIS: I have no record of an invitation, sir.\\nTV Reporter: ... hasn\\'t been seen in public since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference. Some claim he\\'s suffering from post traumatic stress and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight.\\nJARVIS: The render is complete.\\nTony Stark: A little ostentatious, don\\'t you think?\\nJARVIS: What was I thinking? You\\'re usually so discreet.\\nTony Stark: Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.\\nJARVIS: Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.\\nTony Stark: Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.\\nJARVIS: Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.\\nTony Stark: Don\\'t wait up for me, honey.\\nWeapons manufacturing is only one small part of what Stark Industries is all about, and our partnership with the fire and rescue community...\\nRandom Woman: Hey, Tony, remember me?\\nTony Stark: Sure don\\'t. You look great, Hef.\\nObadiah Stane: We\\'re going to have a great quarter.\\nTony Stark: What\\'s the world coming to when a guy\\'s got to crash his own party?\\nObadiah Stane: Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.\\nTony Stark: I\\'ll see you inside.\\nObadiah Stane: Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right? I think I got the board right where we want them\\nTony Stark: You got it. Just cabin fever. I\\'ll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I\\'m starving.\\nAgent Coulson: Mr. Stark?\\nTony Stark: Yeah?\\nAgent Coulson: Agent Coulson.\\nTony Stark: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the..\\nAgent Coulson: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.\\nTony Stark: God, you need a new name for that.\\nAgent Coulson: Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There\\'s still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things.\\nTony Stark: Let\\'s just put something on the books.\\nAgent Coulson: How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?\\nTony Stark: Tell you what. You got it. You\\'re absolutely right. Well, I\\'m going to go to my assistant, and we\\'ll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn\\'t recognize you.\\nPepper Potts: What are you doing here?\\nTony Stark: Just avoiding government agents.\\nPepper Potts: Are you by yourself?\\nTony Stark: Yes. Where\\'d you get that dress?\\nPepper Potts: Oh, it was a birthday present.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s great.\\nPepper Potts: From you, actually.\\nTony Stark: Well, I got great taste.\\nPepper Potts: Yes.\\nTony Stark: You want to dance?\\nPepper Potts: Oh, no.\\nTony Stark: All right, come on.\\nPepper Potts: Thank you. No.\\nTony Stark: Am I making you uncomfortable?\\nPepper Potts: No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.\\nTony Stark: You look great and you smell great.\\nPepper Potts: Oh, God.\\nTony Stark: But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.\\nPepper Potts: I actually don\\'t think that you could tie your shoes without me.\\nTony Stark: I\\'d make it a week. Sure.\\nPepper Potts: Really? What\\'s your Social Security number?\\nTony Stark: Five.\\nPepper Potts: Five?\\nTony Stark: Right.\\nPepper Potts: Right. You\\'re missing just a couple of digits there.\\nTony Stark: The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?\\nPepper Potts: Yes, I need some air. That was totally weird.\\nTony Stark: Totally harmless.\\nPepper Potts: It was totally not harmless, by the way.\\nTony Stark: We\\'re dancing. No one\\'s even watching.\\nEverybody who I work with...\\nNo, you know why?\\nI think you lost objectivity. I think\\nthey just... People... We just danced.\\nPepper Potts: No, it was not just a dance. You don\\'t understand because you\\'re you. And everybody knows exactly who you are and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine. But, you know, then me, you\\'re my boss, and I\\'m dancing with you.\\nTony Stark: I don\\'t think it was taken that way.\\nPepper Potts: Because it makes me look like the one who\\'s trying to...\\nTony Stark: I just think you\\'re overstating it.\\nPepper Potts: You know, and we\\'re here, and then I\\'m wearing this ridiculous dress, and then we were dancing like that and... I would like a drink, please.\\nTony Stark: Got it, okay.\\nPepper Potts: I would like a vodka martini, please.\\nTony Stark: Okay.\\nPepper Potts: Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.\\nTony Stark: Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?\\nChristine Everhart: Wow. Tony Stark.\\nTony Stark: Oh, hey.\\nChristine Everhart: Fancy seeing you here.\\nTony Stark: Carrie.\\nChristine Everhart: Christine.\\nTony Stark: Carrie.\\nChristine Everhart: Christine.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s right.\\nChristine Everhart: You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?\\nTony Stark: Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.\\nChristine Everhart: \\'Cause I was referring to your company\\'s involvement in this latest atrocity\\nTony Stark: Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don\\'t know what to tell you.\\nChristine Everhart: I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.\\nTony Stark: I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn\\'t hear.\\nChristine Everhart: Is this what you call accountability? It\\'s a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?\\nTony Stark: When were these taken?\\nChristine Everhart: Yesterday.\\nTony Stark: I didn\\'t approve any shipment.\\nChristine Everhart: Well, your company did.\\nTony Stark: Well, I\\'m not my company.\\nObadiah Stane: Please, do you mind?\\nTony Stark: Have you seen these pictures? What\\'s going on in Gulmira?\\nObadiah Stane: Tony, Tony. You can\\'t afford to be this naive.\\nTony Stark: You know what? I was naive before, when they said, \"Here\\'s the line. We don\\'t cross it. This is how we do business.\" If we\\'re double-dealing under the table... Are we?\\nReporter: Tony, your picture, please!\\nObadiah Stane: Let\\'s take a picture. Come on. Picture time! Tony. Who do you think locked you out? I was the one who filed the injunction against you. It was the only way I could protect you.\\nObadiah Stane: No. No.\\nTV Reporter: The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there\\'s very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia. Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs, holding them up to anyone who will stop. A child\\'s simple question, \"Where are my mother and father?\" There\\'s very little hope for these refugees, refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.\\nTony Stark: He\\'s all yours.\\n\\n\\nCaptain: What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?\\nCAOC Analyst #1: No sir, they were using human shields. We never got the green light\\nMajor Allen: Put me through to State. They\\'re going to be all over this.\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Get those monitors up!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): We got a bogey!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Wasn\\'t Air Force!\\nMajor Allen: We got the CIA on the line?\\nCaptain: I\\'ve got Langley on the line. They want to know if it\\'s us.\\nCAOC Analyst #1: No, it definitely is not us, sir!\\nCAOC Analyst #2: It wasn\\'t Navy.\\nCAOC Analyst #3: Wasn\\'t Marines.\\nMajor Allen: I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Negative, negative. Cannot identify.\\nMajor Allen: Get me Colonel Rhodes from weapons development down here now!\\nMajor Allen: We ran an ID check and cross-referenced with all known databases. We have nothing.\\nJames Rhodes: Any high-altitude surveillance in the region?\\nCaptain: We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.\\nJames Rhodes: So, this thing just appeared out of nowhere? How come it didn\\'t show up on the radar?\\nCAOC Analyst #1: Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.\\nJames Rhodes: Is it stealth?\\nCAOC Analyst #1: No, sir, it\\'s tiny. We think it\\'s an unmanned aerial vehicle.\\nMajor Allen: Colonel, what are we dealing with here?\\nJames Rhodes: Let me make a call.\\nMajor Allen: Sergeant, clear a hole.\\nTony Stark: Hello?\\nJames Rhodes: Tony?\\nTony Stark: Who\\'s this?\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s Rhodes.\\nTony Stark: Sorry, hello?\\nJames Rhodes: I said it\\'s Rhodes.\\nTony Stark: Speak up, please.\\nJames Rhodes: What in the hell is that noise?\\nTony Stark: Oh, yeah, I\\'m driving with the top down.\\nJames Rhodes: Yeah, well, I need your help right now.\\nTony Stark: It\\'s funny how that works, huh?\\nJames Rhodes: Yeah. Speaking of funny, we\\'ve got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive.\\nTony Stark: Well, that\\'s a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?\\nJames Rhodes: Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?\\nTony Stark: I\\'m not, I was just jogging in the canyon.\\nJames Rhodes: I thought you were driving.\\nTony Stark: Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I\\'m going to jog.\\nJames Rhodes: You sure you don\\'t have any tech in that area I should know about?\\nTony Stark: Nope!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Bogey spotted!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): Whiplash, come in hot.\\nJames Rhodes: Okay, good, \\'cause I\\'m staring at one right now, and it\\'s about to be blown to kingdom come.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s my exit.\\nPilot #1: Ballroom, this is Whiplash One. I\\'ve got the bogey in my sights.\\nJames Rhodes: Whiplash One, what is it?\\nPilot #1: I\\'ve got no idea.\\nMajor Allen: You have radio contact?\\nPilot #1: Non responsive, sir.\\nMajor Allen: Then you are clear to engage.\\nTony Stark: Hit it.\\nPilot #1: That bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!\\nJARVIS: Inbound missile.\\nTony Stark: Flares!\\nPilot #1: Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!\\nTony Stark: Deploy flaps!\\nPilot #2: Holy!\\nCAOC Analyst (offscreen): That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.\\nCAOC Analyst #2: The sat visual has been lost.\\nPilot #1: No way that\\'s a UAV.\\nMajor Allen: What is it?\\nPilot #2: I can\\'t see anything.\\nPilot #1: Whatever it was, it just bought the farm. I think bogey\\'s been handled, sir.\\nJames Rhodes: Hello?\\nTony Stark: Hi, Rhodey, it\\'s me.\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s who?\\nTony Stark: I\\'m sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me.\\nJames Rhodes: No, see, this isn\\'t a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?\\nTony Stark: This is not a piece of equipment. I\\'m in it. It\\'s a suit. It\\'s me!\\nMajor Allen: Rhodey, you got anything for me?\\nMajor Allen: Mark your position and return to base.\\nPilot #1: Roger that, Ballroom.\\nPilot #1: On your belly! It looks like a man! Shake him off! Roll! Roll! I\\'m hit! I\\'m hit!\\nIt\\'s confirmed. He has been hit.\\nPilot #2: Punch out! Punch out! Whiplash One down.\\nWhiplash Two, do you see a chute?\\nPilot #2: Negative! No chute, no chute!\\nPilot #1: My chute\\'s jammed!\\nPilot #2: Sir, I\\'ve got a visual on the bogey.\\nMajor Allen: Whiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it.\\nJames Rhodes: Major, we don\\'t even know what we\\'re shooting at. Call off the Raptors.\\nMajor Allen: That thing just took out an F-22 inside a legal no fly zone! Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!\\nJARVIS: You\\'ve been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.\\nTony Stark1: Keep going!\\nPilot #2: Good chute! Good chute!\\nJames Rhodes: Tony, you still there?\\nTony Stark: Hey, thanks.\\nJames Rhodes: Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right?\\nTony Stark: Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I\\'m working on?\\nJames Rhodes: No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?\\nTony Stark: Training exercise. Isn\\'t that the usual BS?\\nJames Rhodes: It\\'s not that simple. An unfortunate training exercise involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday. I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured. As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira, it is still unclear who or what intervened, but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved. \\nTony Stark: Hey!\\nJARVIS: It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.\\nTony Stark: Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to...\\nJARVIS: Please, try not to move, sir.\\nPepper Potts: What\\'s going on here?\\nTony Stark: Let\\'s face it. This is not the worst thing you\\'ve caught me doing.\\nPepper Potts: Are those bullet holes?\\nWelcome.\\nCompliments of Tony Stark.\\nObadiah Stane: If you\\'d killed him when you were supposed to, you\\'d still have a face.\\nRaza: You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.\\nShow me the weapon.\\nCome. Leave your guards outside.\\nHis escape bore unexpected fruit.\\nSo this is how he did it.\\nThis is only a first, crude effort.\\nStark has perfected his design.\\nHe has made a masterpiece of death.\\nA man with a dozen of these\\ncan rule all of Asia.\\nAnd you dream of Stark\\'s throne.\\nWe have a common enemy.\\nIf we are still in business,\\nI will give you these designs\\nas a gift.\\nAnd in turn,\\nI hope you\\'ll repay me with\\na gift of iron soldiers.\\nTechnology.\\nIt\\'s always been your Achilles\\' heel\\nin this part of the world.\\nDon\\'t worry. It\\'ll only last for 15 minutes.\\nThat\\'s the least of your problems.\\nCrate up the armor and the rest of it.\\nAll right, let\\'s finish up here.\\nSet up Sector underneath the arc reactor,\\nand I\\'m going to want this data masked.\\nRecruit our top engineers.\\nI want a prototype right away.\\nTony Stark: Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You\\'re going to hack into the mainframe and you\\'re going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This\\'ll get you in. It\\'s probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.\\nPepper Potts: And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?\\nTony Stark: Same drill. They\\'ve been dealing under the table, and I\\'m going to stop them. I\\'m going to find my weapons and destroy them.\\nPepper Potts: Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you\\'re going to start all of this again.\\nTony Stark: There is nothing except this. There\\'s no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.\\nPepper Potts: Is that so? Well, then, I quit.\\nTony Stark: You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I\\'m trying to protect the people that I put in harm\\'s way, you\\'re going to walk out?\\nPepper Potts: You\\'re going to kill yourself, Tony. I\\'m not going to be a part of it.\\nTony Stark: I shouldn\\'t be alive, unless it was for a reason. I\\'m not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it\\'s right.\\nPepper Potts: You\\'re all I have, too, you know. Sector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah?\\nVideo Voice Over: You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark. As you can see, Obadiah Stane...\\nPepper Potts: Oh, my God.\\nVideo Voice Over: ... your deception and lies will cost you dearly. The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.\\nObadiah Stane: So, what are we going to do about this? I know what you\\'re going through, Pepper. Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn\\'t he? I was so happy when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead. Now I realize, well, Tony never really did come home, did he? He left a part of himself in that cave. Breaks my heart.\\nPepper Potts: Well, he\\'s a complicated person.\\nObadiah Stane: He\\'s been through a lot. I think he\\'ll be all right. You are a very rare woman. Tony doesn\\'t know how lucky he is.\\nPepper Potts: Thank you. Thanks. I\\'d better get back there.\\nObadiah Stane: Is that today\\'s paper?\\nPepper Potts: Yes.\\nObadiah Stane: Do you mind?\\nPepper Potts: Not at all.\\nObadiah Stane: Puzzle.\\nOf course.\\nTake care.\\nAgent Coulson: Ms. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment?\\nPepper Potts: Nope, right now. Come with me.\\nAgent Coulson: Right now?\\nPepper Potts: We\\'re going to have it right now. Yeah, walk with me.\\nAgent Coulson: Okay.\\nPepper Potts: I\\'m going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office.\\nYeah, we\\'ve been working our best to do it.\\nAbsolutely, we\\'re...\\nI\\'m going to have to call you back.\\nMr. Stane? Sir, we\\'ve explored what you\\'ve asked us, and it seems\\nas though there\\'s a little hiccup.\\n- Actually...\\n- A hiccup?\\nYes, to power the suit, sir,\\nthe technology actually doesn\\'t exist.\\n- So, it\\'s...\\n- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?\\nWilliam, here is the technology.\\nI\\'ve asked you to simply make it smaller.\\nOkay, sir, and that\\'s what we\\'re trying\\nto do, but honestly, it\\'s impossible.\\nObadiah Stane: Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!\\nWell, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m not Tony Stark.\\nPepper Potts: Tony? Tony, are you there? Hello?\\nObadiah Stane: Breathe. Easy, easy. You remember this one, right? It\\'s a shame the government didn\\'t approve it. There\\'s so many applications for causing short-term paralysis. Tony. When I ordered the hit on you, I worried that I was killing the golden goose. But, you see, it was just fate that you survived that. You had one last golden egg to give. Do you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you? Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb. Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you? Oh, it\\'s beautiful. Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony. What a masterpiece. Look at that. This is your legacy. A new generation of weapons with this at its heart. Weapons that will help steer the world back on course, put the balance of power in our hands. The right hands. I wish you could\\'ve seen my prototype. It\\'s not as... Well, not as conservative as yours. Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this. I would have preferred that she lived.\\nJames Rhodes: What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed? Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah... Okay, where\\'s Tony now?\\nPepper Potts: I don\\'t know. He\\'s not answering his phone. Please go over there and make sure everything\\'s okay. Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.\\nTony Stark: Good boy.\\nJames Rhodes: Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony! Tony! You okay?\\nTony Stark: Where\\'s Pepper?\\nJames Rhodes: She\\'s fine. She\\'s with five agents. They\\'re about to arrest Obadiah.\\nTony Stark: That\\'s not going to be enough.\\nPepper Potts: Section 16. Section 16. There it is. My key\\'s not working. It\\'s not opening the door. Oh, wow! What\\'s that? It\\'s, like, a little device. It\\'s, like, a thing that\\'s going to pick the lock?\\nAgent Coulson: You might want to take a few steps back.\\nJames Rhodes: That\\'s the coolest thing I\\'ve ever seen.\\nTony Stark: Not bad, huh? Let\\'s do it.\\nJames Rhodes: You need me to do anything else?\\nTony Stark: Keep the skies clear.\\nJames Rhodes: Damn! Next time, baby.\\nLooks like you were right. He was building a suit.\\nI thought it\\'d be bigger.\\nTony Stark: How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?\\nJARVIS: The suit\\'s at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.\\nTony Stark: Keep me posted. Pepper!\\nPepper Potts: Tony! Tony, are you okay?\\nTony Stark: I\\'m fine. How are...\\nPepper Potts: Obadiah, he\\'s gone insane!\\nTony Stark: I know. Listen, you\\'d better get out of there.\\nPepper Potts: He built a suit.\\nTony Stark: Get out of there right now!\\nWhere do you think you\\'re going?\\nYour services are no longer required.\\nStane!\\nI love this suit!\\n- Put them down!\\nObadiah Stane: Collateral damage, Tony.\\nDivert power to chest RT.\\nPower reduced to 19%.\\nLady!\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no!\\nFor 30 years, I\\'ve been holding you up!\\nI built this company from nothing!\\nNothing is going to stand in my way.\\nLeast of all you!\\nImpressive!\\nYou\\'ve upgraded your armor!\\nI\\'ve made some upgrades of my own!\\nJARVIS: Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.\\nTony Stark: Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.\\nJARVIS: With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that--\\nTony Stark: I know the math! Do it!\\nSir, you\\'re not going to believe this.\\nThat thing is back.\\nGet me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!\\nJames Rhodes: Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise.\\nYes, sir.\\nJARVIS: Thirteen percent power, sir.\\nTony Stark: Climb!\\nJARVIS: Eleven percent.\\nTony Stark: Keep going!\\nJARVIS: Seven percent power.\\nTony Stark: Just leave it on the screen!\\nStop telling me!\\nObadiah Stane: You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!\\nTony Stark: How\\'d you solve the icing problem?\\nObadiah Stane: Icing problem?\\nTony Stark: Might want to look into it.\\nJARVIS: Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power.\\nTony Stark: Potts!\\nPepper Potts: Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?\\nTony Stark: I\\'m almost out of power. I\\'ve got to get out of this thing. I\\'ll be right there.\\nNice try!\\n- Weapons status?\\n- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.\\nFlares!\\nVery clever, Tony.\\nTony Stark: Potts?\\nPepper Potts: Tony!\\nTony Stark: This isn\\'t working. We\\'re going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.\\nPepper Potts: Well, how are you going to do that?\\nTony Stark: You\\'re going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I\\'ll let you know. You\\'re going to hit the master bypass button. It\\'s going to fry everything up here.\\nPepper Potts: Okay. I\\'m going in now.\\nTony Stark: Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I\\'ll buy you some time. This looks important!\\nObadiah Stane: I never had a taste for this sort of thing, but I must admit, I\\'m deeply enjoying the suit! You finally outdid yourself, Tony! You\\'d have made your father proud!\\nPepper Potts: It\\'s ready, Tony! Get off the roof! Tony!\\nObadiah Stane: How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!\\nTony Stark: Pepper!\\nObadiah Stane: And now I\\'m going to kill you with it! You ripped out my targeting system!\\nTony Stark: Time to hit the button!\\nPepper Potts: You told me not to!\\nObadiah Stane: Hold still, you little prick!\\nTony Stark: Just do it!\\nPepper Potts: You\\'ll die!\\nTony Stark: Push it!\\nPepper Potts: Tony!\\nYou\\'ve all received the official statement of what occurred at Stark Industries last night. There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor. Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark\\'s personal security staff...\\nTony Stark: \"Iron Man.\" That\\'s kind of catchy.\\nIt\\'s got a nice ring to it. I mean, it\\'s not technically accurate. The suit\\'s a gold-titanium alloy, but it\\'s kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.\\nAgent Coulson: Here\\'s your alibi.\\nOkay.\\nAgent Coulson: You were on your yacht.\\nYeah.\\nAgent Coulson: We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.\\nTony Stark: See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island.\\nAgent Coulson: That\\'s what happened.\\nAll right.\\nAgent Coulson: Just read it, word for word.\\nTony Stark: There\\'s nothing about Stane here.\\nAgent Coulson: That\\'s being handled. He\\'s on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.\\nTony Stark: But what about the whole cover story that it\\'s a bodyguard? He\\'s my... I mean, is that... That\\'s kind of flimsy, don\\'t you think?\\nAgent Coulson: This isn\\'t my first rodeo, Mr. Stark. Just stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you.\\nYou\\'ve got 90 seconds.\\nPepper Potts: Agent Coulson? I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.\\nAgent Coulson: That\\'s what we do. You\\'ll be hearing from us.\\nPepper Potts: From the Strategic Homeland...\\nAgent Coulson: Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nPepper Potts: Right. Let\\'s get this show on the road.\\nTony Stark: You know, it\\'s actually not that bad. Even I don\\'t think I\\'m Iron Man.\\nPepper Potts: You\\'re not Iron Man.\\nTony Stark:  Am so.\\nPepper Potts: You\\'re not.\\nTony Stark:  All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I\\'d have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She\\'d be a wreck, \\'cause she\\'d always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I\\'d become. She\\'d be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night.\\nPepper Potts: What night?\\nTony Stark: You know.\\nPepper Potts: Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you\\'re talking about? Thought so. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\\nTony Stark: Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.\\nJames Rhodes: And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement. He will not be taking any questions.\\nTony Stark: Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I\\'ll stick to the cards this time. There\\'s been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...\\nChristine Everhart: I\\'m sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you...\\nTony Stark: I know that it\\'s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I\\'m a superhero.\\nChristine Everhart: I never said you were a superhero.\\nTony Stark: Didn\\'t? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I\\'m just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I\\'ve made, largely public. \\nJames Rhodes: Just stick to the cards, man.\\nTony Stark: Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man.\\n[After end-credits. Tony reaches home]\\nTony Stark: Jarvis!\\nJARVIS: [distorted] Welcome home, Sir. [Jarvis cuts out]\\nNick Fury: \"I am Iron Man.\" You think you\\'re the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you\\'ve become part of a bigger universe. You just don\\'t know it yet.\\nTony Stark: Who the hell are you?\\nNick Fury: [appears in light] Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nTony Stark: [nonchalantly] Ah.\\nNick Fury: I\\'m here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative.'"
